Article,source,rating"Tom Magliozzi, one of public radio's most popular personalities, died on Monday of complications from Alzheimer's disease. He was 77 years old.Tom and his brother, Ray, became famous as ""Click and Clack the Tappet Brothers"" on the weekly NPR show Car Talk. They bantered, told jokes, laughed and sometimes even gave pretty good advice to listeners who called in with their car troubles.If there was one thing that defined Tom Magliozzi, it was his laugh. It was loud, it was constant, it was infectious.Courtesy of Car Talk""His laugh is the working definition of infectious laughter,"" says Doug Berman, the longtime producer of Car Talk. He remembers the first time he ever encountered Magliozzi.""Before I ever met him, I heard him, and it wasn't on the air,"" he recalls.Berman was the news director of WBUR at the time.""I'd just hear this laughter,"" he says. ""And then there'd be more of it, and people would sort of gather around him. He was just kind of a magnet.""The Magliozzi brothers grew up in a tough neighborhood of East Cambridge, Mass., in a close-knit Italian family. Tom was 12 years older, the beloved older brother to Ray. They liked to act like they were just a couple of regular guys who happened to be mechanics, but both of them graduated from MIT.After getting out of college, Tom Magliozzi went to work as an engineer. One day he had a kind of epiphany, he told graduates when he and Ray gave the 1999 commencement address at their alma mater.thumbnailNPR's Holiday FavoritesA 'Car Talk Carol'He was on his way to work when he had a near-fatal accident with a tractor-trailer. He pulled off the road and decided to do something different with his life.""I quit my job,"" he said. ""I became a bum. I spent two years sitting in Harvard Square drinking coffee. I invented the concept of the do-it-yourself auto repair shop, and I met my lovely wife.""Well, he wasn't exactly a bum; he worked as a consultant and college professor, eventually getting a doctoral degree in marketing. And Tom and Ray Magliozzi did open that do-it-yourself repair shop in the early '70s. They called it Hackers Haven. Later they opened a more traditional car repair shop called the Good News Garage.They got into radio by accident when someone from the local public radio station, WBUR, was putting together a panel of car mechanics for a talk show.""They called Ray, and Ray thought it was a dumb idea, so he said, 'I'll send my brother' and Tom thought, 'Great, I'll get out of breaking my knuckles for a couple of hours.' And he went over and he was the only one who showed up,"" Berman says.Berman says the station liked what Tom did and asked him to come back the next week. This time he brought Ray. The rest, as they say, is history.In 1987 Car Talk went national on NPR. The Magliozzi brothers were a huge success. Listeners loved their blend of humor, passion, expertise and just plain silliness.The Tollbooth FugitiveOn one episode of Car Talk, a woman called in because she had failed to pay a toll on a bridge and was worried about getting caught. Tom had the idea of calling the person in charge of the bridge. The ensuing conversation is hilarious.'At The Last Minute, I Realized That I'm In A Coins-Only Lane'PlaylistWhen it came to cars, Berman says the brothers really did know what they were talking about. But, he says, that's not why people listen to the show.""I think it has very little to do with cars,"" he says. ""It's the guys' personalities. And Tom especially „ really a genius. With a great, facile mind. And he's mischievous. He likes to prod people into honesty.""It is almost impossible to talk about Tom Magliozzi without talking about Ray. Berman says the affection you heard on the radio dated back to their childhood „ and it was real.Remembering Tom MagliozziShare Your Stories About Tom On CarTalk.com""For Ray, he idolized Tom. This is the guy who introduced him to everything in life, and Tom liked having his little brother around,"" Berman says. ""He liked the guy. So when they grew up they were really, really great friends.""Tom and Ray haven't done the show live for two years; Car Talk has been airing archives of old shows. Berman says Ray would like to continue doing that, as a tribute to his brother.",npr,0.2"Twice a year, most Americans do a truly bizarre thing. In coordinated fashion, we change our clocks an hour ahead or behind and proceed as if the new time tells us what we should be doing: when to eat, when to sleep, when to wake and when to work.The earth, of course, spins and rotates on its merry course, unperturbed by our temporal machinations. If we used to wake after sunrise, we might now wake before morning light. If we used to drive home with the setting sun, we might now drive home in darkness.The experience can be discombobulating. Our appetite typically rises and falls throughout the day in predictable fashion, along with alertness, arousal, sleepiness and the hundreds of subtle gradations of experience governed by circadian rhythms: biological processes that cycle with a roughly 24-hour period. When we suddenly shift our behavior as we ""spring forward"" in March or ""fall back"" in November, it takes those biological processes time to catch up, and the experience is rarely a pleasant one.To better understand the underlying biology, I turned to my colleague Lance Kriegsfeld, an associate professor in psychology and at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. His research focuses on how circadian rhythms arise and their impact on a variety of biological systems and processes, including hormones and reproduction, typically in rodents, our not-so-distant kin.Prof. Kriegsfeld was kind enough to answer a few questions in an interview by e-mail:TL: How are rodents affected by a disruption to their circadian rhythms?LK: Although rodents do not wake up to an alarm and wait for the clock to strike 5:00 so that they can end their busy work days, their brain and body clocks are still precisely synchronized to daily changes in the light-dark cycle. If the light-dark cycle is shifted, rodents experience this 'jet lag' the same as humans. It takes them a few days to begin waking up at the new time, they are hungry at the wrong time of day, their immune function is impaired, and they have difficulty learning new tasks. For example, rats that are jet lagged after learning to avoid a particular location experience pronounced retrograde amnesia, basically forgetting that they ever learned which location to avoid.TL: So is that what happens to humans with daylight saving time?LK: Although the adjustment for daylight saving time is only one hour, the effect on our brains and bodies can still be significant. While adjusting to the new time, we experience sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating at work, and even a modest increased likelihood of heart attack in at-risk individuals. These consequences are not as bad in the fall as the spring as our internal clock can recover from ""falling back"" easier than ""springing forward.""TL: Why is it easier to shift time in one direction than the other?LK: The circadian clock in our brains has an easier time readjusting to travel from east to west or, in the case of daylight saving time, ""falling back."" The specific cellular mechanisms underlying this differential ability to shift forward or back are not yet fully understood.TL: What's the most dramatic effect of a disruption to circadian rhythms that you've seen in your own work?LK: We were quite surprised to see that twice weekly six-hour advances of the light-dark cycle, for four weeks, caused a greater than 50 percent reduction in the birth of new cells in the brains of hamsters. New cells are added every day to the memory center in our brains to help learn and retain new information. This reduction in new cell birth led to dramatic deficits in learning and memory that lasted at least a month after the jet lag ended. We knew jet lag was bad for the brain, but were surprised by how bad!TL: Is there an analogue in humans?LK: In one study of female flight attendants, women that worked for airlines that did not schedule within-time-zone flights after a significant jet lag, to permit recovery, experienced significant learning and memory deficits. Most strikingly, these women exhibited smaller temporal lobe volumes if they worked for such airlines for three years or more. Although it is impossible to determine whether or not these women had smaller temporal lobes prior to working for the airline, given our findings in hamsters, we suspect that repeated jet lag might cause reductions in brain cell birth in humans as well.TL: I understand that the rats and mice in your own experiments don't observe daylight saving time. Why not?LK: In the midst of an experiment, simply changing the light-dark cycle by one hour can have such a pronounced impact on the physiology and behavior of the animals that experimental results gathered at this time may be inaccurate. My suggestion for anyone studying rodents is to either maintain a static light-dark cycle or avoid collecting any data until a few days after the time change „ the latter solution also being relevant for researchers studying human populations.TL: Finally, any advice for readers dealing with the effects of this week's time change?LK: It is best to avoid caffeine and alcohol as both can alter the timing of our internal clocks. Also, food is a powerful synchronizer of our circadian clocks, so it is good to eat on the new time schedule rather than eating when you are hungry based on your previous schedule. Finally, if you typically have difficulty falling asleep at the new time, melatonin might be helpful if taken, as your doctor recommends, before bedtime.Of course, reading the latest 13.7 post like clockwork each morning helps, too.",npr,0.2"Brittany Maynard was a beautiful anomaly.Most 29-year-olds don't get incurable brain cancer. Most young cancer patients don't choose assisted suicide when given a terminal diagnosis, or decide, as Maynard and her husband did, to pack up and move to another state so she could have that choice.And Maynard also decided to let the world in on her excruciating choice, opening herself and her family up to criticism at a time when that's the last thing they needed.This undated photo provided by the Maynard family shows Brittany Maynard, who ended her life on Saturday.The Two-WayAs Planned, Right-To-Die Advocate Brittany Maynard Ends Her LifeSince news of Maynard's decision first surfaced, I've been thinking a lot about what I would do if I got a terminal diagnosis, or if someone I love does. I don't know. But American health care often does a spectacularly bad job of caring for people as they're dying. And as Dr. Atul Gawande points out in his new book, Being Mortal, young patients like Brittany are most likely to be given the ""live longer at any cost"" approach:Younger people are much more likely to get aggressive therapy till the end, have much more suffering at the end, and have their families experience PTSD and depression after their passing.In part, that's because it's such a violation that any young person should die. It's hard to back off the goal of trying for more time no matter what, towards insuring as good a life as possible in the time we have remaining with them.Maria Fabrizio for NPRShots - Health NewsHow A Woman's Plan To Kill Herself Helped Her Family GrieveMaynard's husband and family seemed in unison in trying for ""as good a life as possible"" in her final days. But I can imagine struggling with it if my mom said she wanted to make an early exit. That's what happened to Emily Bem, whose mother, a psychology professor diagnosed with Alzheimer's, told the family she planned to commit suicide before she lost the ability to think. My NPR colleague Alix Spiegel told the family's story:They settled on Tuesday, May 20, and announced the date to the family at a meeting at their home in Ithaca.And even though Emily Bem had supported her mother's decision, this date „ the cold reality of it „ was very hard to accept.""I said she seemed too well and it seemed too soon. I felt really angry. I felt they were all wrong,"" Emily says.Ultimately what made it possible for Emily to accept her mother's choice was a get-together for family and friends with her mother.""It was just so obvious that this is about as good as it gets for a human exit,"" Emily says. ""She was surrounded by everyone who loved her, they were telling her how and why they loved her. This was not a bad way to go.""The people who choose assisted suicide are typically much more like Emily's mother than like Brittany „ they're older than 65. They also tend to be white, well-educated and to have put a great deal of thought into their choice. And most who ask about the option don't follow through in the end.Indeed, a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine found that just 16 percent of 114 terminal cancer patients who had asked about assisted suicide at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance eventually decided to kill themselves. Only one-third filled the prescription. Most never continued beyond their first inquiry. ""Qualitatively, patients and families were grateful to receive the lethal prescription, whether it was used or not,"" the study authors wrote.In The Fault in Our Stars, Gus and Hazel, played by Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley, play two teenagers with cancer.Shots - Health NewsCancer When You're Young Isn't Always 'The Fault In Our Stars'The most common reason people gave considering assisted suicide was fear of a loss of autonomy.If those numbers hold true, assisted suicide will remain the choice of very few people, even if it becomes legal in more states. And even people who decided in the end to make that choice don't say it's easy. Ethan Remmel, a psychology professor with cancer who died at age 41, wrote eloquently about the process, about his frustration that his family and doctors seemed to value quantity of life over quality, and about his grief at a life cut short.Three days before he died, he wrote that he had come to terms with that loss:Average survival time from my diagnosis is around two years. I will survive only about half of that. But I do not feel like a failure. I did the best I could with the time that I had. I may not look like a success as a dot on a graph, but I feel like one. Birth and death may not be pretty or pleasant, but we can still be proud of how we handle them.Peace and love,Ethan Remmel",npr,0.2"Nigeria has been a stubborn hot spot of polio „ and that turned out to be a good thing when it came time to fight Ebola.In late July, a patient with the deadly Ebola virus arrived from Liberia. Health workers knew what to do. The country has created a massive public health effort to wipe out polio; institutions and strategies were repurposed to fight Ebola.On the other hand, anti-polio efforts in the countries hit hardest by Ebola are on hold „ and that could lead to disaster.First, the good news, from Nigeria.One of the country's polio institutions is an emergency operations center run by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. At the request of the government, senior officials from the center were sent to Lagos to help set up an emergency operations center for Ebola.Because of the anti-polio efforts, health workers in Nigeria were ready for Ebola. They had already been trained in contact tracing. And hospitals had procedures in place for reporting polio cases, says Jay Wenger, head of polio efforts at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provides financial support to NPR as well as the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.""How you organize a team, how you collect the information, how you collate the information and make it available, is all part of the deal with polio,"" says Wenger. ""They just transferred some of those techniques to the Ebola response."" Nigeria was declared Ebola-free the second week of October.There's a lesson to be learned, says Wenger: it's a good idea to have resources and trained personnel capable of dealing with more than just a single disease. ""Both polio and Ebola are examples of diseases we can handle if we have the adequate kind of health systems around,"" he says. ""We need to do what we can to strengthen the health systems in many underdeveloped countries.""But it takes time to create such systems. That means bad news on the polio front in the three countries with the highest Ebola counts.In September, 18 African countries including Nigeria synchronized a polio vaccination campaign, and reached 94 million children. Successful immunization requires several boosters, so a second campaign is starting up now. But Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone didn't take part in the first round and aren't taking part in the second round either.""This is a huge risk to polio eradication,"" says World Health Organization spokeswoman Sona Bari. ""They're unprotected from any potential importation of polio."" And they're missing other childhood vaccinations as well.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is not planning any more immunization campaigns through the end of the year. ""One can't argue with that,"" says Bari. ""Countries need to be able to muster whatever health services they have in order to respond to the Ebola outbreak.""But there's that ""one plane flight away"" problem that is critical for both Ebola and polio. If someone carrying the polio virus wanders into one of those West African countries, an epidemic could spark.And cases of polio could very well go unnoticed. Some of the most educated health care workers in the Ebola-affected countries have died; those who remain are busy with Ebola.There's already a sign that fewer health officials are looking for polio. The explanation is a little convoluted, so hang on. Sudden paralysis in children is a hallmark of the polio virus but also other can be caused by infectious organisms, congenital problems, exposure to toxic chemicals and more. Health officials at the World Health Organization look for a sudden paralysis rate in children under 15 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea of 2 in 100,000. But reports are down in those countries, says Bari, suggesting that there's not much polio surveillance.Missing a single case could send polio numbers ballooning. ""If we take our eye off the ball we're up to 200,000 cases a year in the next ten years,"" says Carol Pandak, global director of Rotary International's Polio Plus Program.Related NPR StoriesThe Comeback Of Polio Is A Public Health Emergency May 5, 2014Rotary, a coalition of volunteer groups around the world focused on public service projects, has been fighting polio for 35 years. Pandak says they're not backing down now. The organization is continuing to support vaccination campaigns. ""We've done nothing differently,"" she says. And they're working to expand their polio work. Rotary International is just beginning to get proposals from the three Ebola-affected countries for information campaigns for health workers, to piggyback on Ebola training.Pandak remains optimistic. Nigeria, which has been the source of polio cases throughout Africa, has been polio-free since July. ""Africa has never been closer to stopping polio than today,"" she says. Rotarians in Maine have been planning a trip to Nigeria in a few weeks to work on the polio vaccination campaign, and they have no plans to cancel because of Ebola.",npr,0.2"""My own personal opinion is that time is a human construct,"" says Tom O'Brian. O'Brian has thought a lot about this over the years. He is America's official timekeeper at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado.To him, days, hours, minutes and seconds are a way for humanity to ""put some order in this very fascinating and complex universe around us.""We bring that order using clocks, and O'Brian oversees America's master clock. It's one of the most accurate clocks on the planet: an atomic clock that uses oscillations in the element cesium to count out 0.0000000000000001 second at a time. If the clock had been started 300 million years ago, before the age of dinosaurs began, it would still be keeping time „ down to the second. But the crazy thing is, despite knowing the time better than almost anyone on Earth, O'Brian can't explain time.""We can measure time much better than the weight of something or an electrical current,"" he says, ""but what time really is, is a question that I can't answer for you.""Maybe its because we don't understand time, that we keep trying to measure it more accurately. But that desire to pin down the elusive ticking of the clock may soon be the undoing of time as we know it: The next generation of clocks will not tell time in a way that most people understand.The New ClockAt the nearby University of Colorado Boulder is a clock even more precise than the one O'Brian watches over. The basement lab that holds it is pure chaos: Wires hang from the ceilings and sprawl across lab tables. Binder clips keep the lines bunched together.In fact, this knot of wires and lasers actually is the clock. It's spread out on a giant table, parts of it wrapped in what appears to be tinfoil. Tinfoil?""That's research grade tinfoil,"" says Travis Nicholson, a graduate student here at the JILA, a joint institute between NIST and CU-Boulder. Nicholson and his fellow graduate students run the clock day to day. Most of their time is spent fixing misbehaving lasers and dealing with the rats' nest of wires. (""I think half of them go nowhere,"" says graduate student Sara Campbell.)At the heart of this new clock is the element strontium. Inside a small chamber, the strontium atoms are suspended in a lattice of crisscrossing laser beams. Researchers then give them a little ping, like ringing a bell. The strontium vibrates at an incredibly fast frequency. It's a natural atomic metronome ticking out teeny, teeny fractions of a second.This new clock can keep perfect time for 5 billion years.""It's about the whole, entire age of the earth,"" says Jun Ye, the scientist here at JILA who built this clock. ""Our aim is that we'll have a clock that, during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second.""But this new clock has run into a big problem: This thing we call time doesn't tick at the same rate everywhere in the universe. Or even on our planet.Time UndoneRight now, on the top of Mount Everest, time is passing just a little bit faster than it is in Death Valley. That's because speed at which time passes depends on the strength of gravity. Einstein himself discovered this dependence as part of his theory of relativity, and it is a very real effect.The relative nature of time isn't just something seen in the extreme. If you take a clock off the floor, and hang it on the wall, Ye says, ""the time will speed up by about one part in 1016.""The world's most precise atomic clock is a mess to look at. But it can tick for billions of years without loosing a second.iThe world's most precise atomic clock is a mess to look at. But it can tick for billions of years without loosing a second.Ye group and Baxley/JILA/FlickrThat is a sliver of a second. But this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter until now. But this new clock is so sensitive, little changes in height throw it way off. Lift it just a couple of centimeters, Ye says, ""and you will start to see that difference.""This new clock can sense the pace of time speeding up as it moves inch by inch away from the earth's core.That's a problem, because to actually use time, you need different clocks to agree on the time. Think about it: If I say, 'let's meet at 3:30,' we use our watches. But imagine a world in which your watch starts to tick faster, because you're working on the floor above me. Your 3:30 happens earlier than mine, and we miss our appointment.This clock works like that. Tiny shifts in the earth's crust can throw it off, even when it's sitting still. Even if two of them are synchronized, their different rates of ticking mean they will soon be out of synch. They will never agree.The world's current time is coordinated between atomic clocks all over the planet. But that can't happen with the new one.""At this level, maintaining absolute time scale on earth is in fact turning into nightmare,"" Ye says. This clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic. It is turning our sense of time into chaos.Ye suspects the only way we will be able to keep time in the future is to send these new clocks into space. Far from the earth's surface, the clocks would be better able to stay in synch, and perhaps our unified sense of time could be preserved.But the NIST's chief timekeeper, Tom O'Brian, isn't worried about all this. As confusing as these clocks are, they're going to be really useful.""Scientists can make these clocks into exquisite devices for sensing a whole bunch of different things,"" O'Brian says. Their extraordinary sensitivity to gravity might allow them to map the interior of the earth, or help scientists find water and other resources underground.A network of clocks in space might be used to detect gravitational waves from black holes and exploding stars.They could change our view of the universe.They just may not be able to tell us the time.",npr,0.2"Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old who said she had terminal brain cancer, took medication to end her life under Oregon's ""Death with Dignity Act,"" advocacy group Compassion & Choices said Sunday.""Brittany chose to make a well thought out and informed choice to Die With Dignity in the face of such a terrible, painful, and incurable illness,"" a post on her website said.

If we change our thoughts, we change our world! Love and peace to you all,"" she said.Maynard graduated from University of California, Berkeley, and earned a Masters in Education from University of California, Irvine, according to the obituary. She was a world traveler who volunteered at a local animal rescue organization before her diagnosis and lived 29 years of ""generosity, compassion, education, travel, and humor,"" it said.Maynard is survived by her husband and his family, her mother and stepfather.""While she had longed for children of her own, she left this world with zero regrets on time spent, places been, or people she loved in her 29 years,"" the obituary said.Maynard ticks off last item on bucket listMaynard's story spread rapidly on social media as a video explaining her choice garnered more than 9 million views on YouTube.She became a prominent spokeswoman for the ""death with dignity"" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms. She also became a lightning rod for criticism from people who oppose that approach.""I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family,"" Maynard wrote in an opinion column for CNN explaining her choice. ""We had to uproot from California to Oregon, because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized."" Maynard: I hope my family is proud of me Explaining 'Death with Dignity' law Brittany Maynard: I don't want to dieIn a video released last week, Maynard said she hadn't yet decided when she would end her life.""I still feel good enough, and I still have enough joy, and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now. But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week,"" Maynard said in the video, which was produced by Compassion & Choices and released to CNN last Wednesday.My mother deserved to 'die with dignity'Maynard said she had stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer.When she first started speaking out about her decision, Maynard said that in early November she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed. In her latest video, she said she was waiting to see how her symptoms progress before deciding on a date.But taking too long to make that choice was one of her greatest fears, Maynard said.""The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,"" she says, ""but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease, because of the nature of my cancer.""",cnn,0.4"Our trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table was rich with 2014 insights, including a key test in Texas and questions about whether a GOP Senate majority would bring a new chapter in President Obama's relationship with the man he may face in many high-stakes negotiations.1. A ripple or a wave? In the House, the 2014 margin mattersThere is little drama about control of the House of Representatives: Republicans are all but certain to hold -- and build -- their majority. GOP wave in the House?But the number matters. Modest gains for the GOP, and maybe the Democrats sweep back into power in 2016; larger gains and perhaps we see a GOP majority until after the post-2020 Census redistricting.Jonathan Martin of The New York Times took us inside the calculations, and showed how the results could impact the next step for the Republican in charge of the House campaign effort.""If they get 12 to 15 (seats) or even beyond that, it could make it really hard for Democrats to retake the House until they redraw the lines after 2020,"" said Martin. ""I talked to the chairman of the (National Republican Congressional Committee), Greg Walden, on Saturday, and he lowballed the gains to me at six to eight. Most folks think it will be a little higher than that.""""And notably, by the way, Chairman Walden said he wants to stay at the NRCC. There's been chatter about him being forced out. He said: 'I'm staying.'""2. Mr. President, meet Mitch McConnellObama and GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky served together in the Senate, and of course have been political rivals for the past six years. Democrats point to the pledge from McConnell early in the Obama administration to do all he could to make the president a one-term commander in chief.But despite being on the opposite sides of big political battles -- or maybe because of that fact -- the two have a virtually nonexistent personal relationship. Even less interaction -- and familiarity -- than the President has with House Speaker John Boehner.Dan Balz of The Washington Post noted that this would be the most important relationship in Washington if McConnell becomes the Senate majority leader come January. He raised the question of whether the two will make mutual efforts to get to know each other better.3. Will Democrats see encouraging signs, or learn ""Don't mess with Texas""?Democratic hopes of winning the Texas governor's race have faded, big-time. But the party still has a lot at stake in Tuesday's election, which will add new data to the debate about whether the state's shifting demographics are moving the state away from its Republican red roots.Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reported that Democrats are hoping, even while expecting defeat in the state's top race, to see building blocks of a new Texas coalition.""Democrats have poured roughly $10 million into that campaign as part of Battleground Texas -- really hoping to change the makeup of the electorate,"" said Henderson. ""If that electorate isn't changed come Tuesday, Republicans are going to have something to crow about. And it will send a message to Democrats -- don't mess with Texas, at least no time soon.""4. Waiting for Clinton until March, April or May?The 2016 presidential campaign has been a big subplot of the 2014 midterm season, but will get even more attention once all the votes are counted Tuesday.And some Democrats think the best thing Hillary Clinton could do for the party is to end the suspense, if there is any, and officially declare she is running. Others, though, say why rush, given her overwhelming advantage among Democrats.CNN's Peter Hamby took us inside a debate that is about to get a lot more attention.""That big galaxy of people around her are debating should she get in early, very quickly, deny oxygen to any potential challenger, build an organization so she can start raising money, hiring staff, polling, et cetera -- or should she wait until the spring,"" said Hamby.""I talked to one Democrat who said she should wait until March, April or May because she doesn't have to get into the mix and answer questions from reporters and take every arrow coming at her from the media or Republicans. ""5. Two big wins for Obama, but deep gains for the GOPRepublicans complain about Obama with every breath, but you can make a case they will miss him. Yes, the President has won two convincing Electoral College victories, and in the process exposed profound GOP demographic weaknesses when it comes to presidential politics. Party split, then and nowBut down the ballot, the Obama years have been boom times for the GOP.Consider the ""then"" and ""now"" at several levels:´ Democrats had 257 House seats and the majority at the beginning of Obama's term; now they are in the minority, with 201.´ There were 27 Democratic governors at the beginning; 21 now.´ The number of Democrats in state legislatures -- a key proving ground for future stars -- is down a whopping 600 over the past six years.´ In the Senate, this year's biggest battleground, the change is less dramatic: 57 Democratic senators early in the Obama presidency, 53 now, or 55 if you count the two independents who caucus with the Democrats.Any president's party normally take a big hit in the so-called ""six-year itch"" midterm, so it will be worth looking again at those numbers in a week.But if Republicans fail to take control of the Senate, given the favorable climate and map this year, the political conversation is likely to be as much, if not more, about the GOP's damaged brand as it is about the numbers showing how the party has prospered these past six years.",cnn,0.4"Days after Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo disintegrated above California, killing one of its co-pilots, Virgin founder Richard Branson says making commercial space travel a reality is worth the risks involved.The accident killed co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injured co-pilot Peter Siebold, who managed to parachute to the ground.Branson paid tribute to Alsbury in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday.""He was an extremely brave man -- as all test pilots are, extremely brave people. He had a young family, he was married and his family loved him enormously,"" Branson said.""But he was a test pilot, and test pilots are trying to discover things that 400 engineers and technicians on the ground can't necessarily see on the ground. And the test pilots push the aircraft to the limit before, finally, members of the traveling public are allowed on it."" NTSB releases more info on Virgin crash Virgin Galactic spacecraft fails Virgin Galactic: Concerned for pilotsAsked if, in light of Friday's accident, he stood by his comment to Harlow on the space program last year that ""unless you risk something, the world stands still,"" Branson told her that he did.""Yes, the risk is worth it,"" he said. ""Mike would have been the first to say that. I'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that, but test pilots would say that, because the risk they're taking, they know the importance of what they're doing,"" he said.""We've got to go through the difficult testing stage of creating a space line in order to make it safe for travelers who want to travel on that space line in the years ahead, and we will persevere and we will succeed.""What caused the crash?SpaceShipTwo disintegrated just two minutes after separated from the jet-powered aircraft that carried it aloft Friday.At the time, the space plane was about 45,000 feet above the ground and about 20 miles northeast of Mojave, California.A team of 13 to 15 investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be in the Mojave Desert for about a week. But analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer, and the investigation may take up to a year.Opinion: The truth about launching spaceshipsBranson warned against speculating before the board releases its findings.""The British press have, I think rather irresponsibly, speculated that it might've been rockets exploding, it might have been fuel tanks exploding, in fact there might have been an explosion.""The NTSB have firmly ruled all that out and have made it clear that they're coming down to one particular thing that they think might have happened. But if you don't mind, I'm going to leave it to the NTSB to let you know exactly what it is they think happened, and then we'll wait for their definitive decision,"" he told Harlow.Friday's flight was the first to use a new plastic-based fuel, something that CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien has said could have affected the plane's stability, despite the fuel tanks being found intact. Branson tweet: Thanks for support Miles O'Brien: A huge loss for aviation SpaceShipTwo has 'anomaly' in test flightO'Brien said that Virgin Galactic had ""consistently underestimated the risk involved.""Branson denied this, saying that 400 ""of the best engineers in the world"" were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the Atlantic in the 1920s and '30s.'Feathering'On Sunday, the NTSB revealed two clues about what went wrong, both involving the spacecraft's ""feathering,"" a process used to stabilize and slow the spacecraft down toward Earth.During feathering, two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the ""feathers"" -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship, making the vehicle look like it's arching its back as it descends.But on Friday, ""the feather lock-unlock lever was moved by the co-pilot from the locked position to the unlocked position"" prematurely, the NTSB said.On top of that, the feathers aren't supposed to move until a separate feathering handle is activated. No one adjusted that handle; yet the feathers were still deployed, NTSB acting Chairman Christopher Hart said.But Hart stressed that it was unclear whether pilot error, mechanical problems or another possibility caused the spacecraft to break apart in the air.""We are still a long way from finding a cause,"" Hart said. ""We are months and months away.""Despite a debris field spanning 5 miles, investigators have found almost all the parts of the spacecraft needed for the investigation, Hart said.Investigation may take up to a yearVeteran pilot killedA memorial fund has been set up for Alsbury's family.He worked at Scaled Composites, the company that partnered with Virgin on the test flight program, and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft.Analysis: Will space accidents deter pioneer tourists?Scaled Composites said Sunday that co-pilot Siebold -- the company's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors.""We remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees, as well as the agencies investigating the accident,"" Scaled Composites said.NTSB investigators have yet to interview Siebold. ""We have not because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage,"" Hart said.SpaceShipTwo helmed by experienced pilots when flight failedFuture of the programFor years, Virgin Galactic had planned to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo would transport passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground.Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights.Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official saysSeveral celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking.Friday's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the Virgin Galactic space program. In 2007, three employees of Scaled Composites were killed during testing in the Mojave Desert. Sources told CNN that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo.",cnn,0.4"Love was in the air on Sunday for Dottie Coven and Keith Stewart.Business travelers and frequent fliers on Southwest Airlines, the couple from Corydon, Indiana, decided there was no place they'd rather marry than while flying.And why not land at the airport known for love -- Dallas Love Field -- after the happy occasion? Couple have one-of-a-kind wedding in airThat's why they approached Southwest with their idea of being married in the air. The airline was game. After all, it's famous for its fun, including flight attendants who entertain, wedding proposals and even rewarding flight attendants who are especially good to customers (After a customer praised one flight attendant on Twitter midflight, the airline publicly honored her with a giant cookie).But this was the Southwest's first wedding where the airline joined the wedding planning team from departure gate to arrival gate. (Follow the fun using Southwest's hashtag #nonstoplove.)With a band playing and balloons decorating the jetway, the happy couple and about 30 friends and family boarded Southwest Flight 4058 in Nashville for the ceremony. About 100 unsuspecting fellow passengers received an extra boarding pass inviting them to celebrate.A flower girl walking down the aisle handed out peanuts to start the ceremony, followed by an officiant using the loudspeaker to perform the marriage of Coven and Stewart.There were modifications for the unique location: ""If anyone can show just cause why they might not be lawfully joined together, let them push their flight attendant call button now or forever hold your peace.""The airline had a reason for highlighting this particular route: The wedding took place on Southwest's first nonstop flight from Nashville to Dallas Love Field.The airline had been prevented from offering that particular route under the Wright Amendment, which Congress passed in 1979 to allow only flights from Love Field to neighboring states (with a few exceptions). Congress repealed the law in 2006, and it expired in October.The Stewarts were heading to their honeymoon in Puerto Rico on Monday morning, a gift of the airline. Puerto Rico is another relatively new destination for Southwest Airlines, which moved into the international market after its 2010 purchase of AirTran (and its international routes).",cnn,0.4"Swirling winds and heavy downpours probably did more than the massive Israeli police presence to dampen Palestinian protests in Jerusalem over the weekend.Dire predictions that a third intifada was about to erupt after the brief closure of the Temple Mount -- known to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary -- came to nothing. But the weather could not sweep away the toxic atmosphere in the city.Tension in Jerusalem is perhaps at its greatest since the end of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, ten years ago -- stoked by a rash of what some call hate crimes and others acts of terror. Regular -- almost daily -- outbreaks of stone-throwing by Palestinian teenagers are answered by tear gas and rubber bullets; hundreds of minors have already had their first taste of jail.The city's mayor, describing the violence as intolerable, has announced that surveillance balloons equipped with HD cameras will be deployed above troublesome neighborhoods to prevent disturbances. The Israeli cabinet is considering legislation that would introduce prison terms of up to 20 years for throwing stones.One of the most restive neighborhoods in Jerusalem is Silwan, a densely-packed area in the shadow of the Temple Mount, where there is little work, a heavy police presence and a growing colony of Jewish settlers, moving into properties bought from Palestinians.Touchstone issue Temple Mount crisis fuels unrest Tensions mounting in Jerusalem Palestinians furious over Al-Aqsa closing Israel closes Al Aqsa after shooting Holy site closed for first time in yearsLast month, a Palestinian from Silwan drove his car into passengers getting off a tram in Jerusalem, killing a baby and injuring several others, including a woman who died later. And last week, a 32-year-old Palestinian shot and gravely wounded a right-wing rabbi, Yehuda Glick, as he left a Jerusalem conference called ""The Jewish people return to the Temple Mount.""READ: Israel partially reopens access to Temple MountGlick, now in a serious but stable condition in hospital, has long argued that the Jews must have a place of worship on the Temple Mount, a touchstone issue for Muslims who suspect a plan to expel them from the site, where the al Aqsa mosque is also situated.Glick's view is supported by some elected officials, including Housing Minister Uri Ariel and Deputy Speaker of the Knesset (and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party) Moshe Feiglin.Glick's assailant, Mutaz Hijazi, who had spent more than a decade in prison, in part for crimes of violence, was shot dead by an Israeli counter-terror unit hours later. Hundreds of Palestinians attended Hijazi's funeral; his father said that if Hijazi had shot Glick it was because ""occupation equals resistance.""Israeli authorities reacted to the attempted assassination of Glick by closing the al Aqsa mosque altogether for one day, then restricting access to men over 50 years of age and women, and putting thousands more police on the streets. The Palestinian Authority described the closure -- the first in 14 years -- as a ""declaration of war."" There were also harsh words from Jordan, which remains the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem according to its peace treaty with Israel.In such an environment acts of political violence can spark outsize responses and set off an uncontrollable chain of events. The killing of three Jewish teenagers in the West Bank back in May, which Israel said was the work of Hamas, sparked a crisis that ultimately led to the Gaza conflict. In July, the abduction and murder of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem provoked serious rioting. Three Israelis are on trial for the killing.Feiglin said ""the government's weakness and incompetence in handling terrorism"" were responsible for the attempt of Glick's life. Early on Sunday morning, with a police guard, Feiglin returned to the Temple Mount in defiance of an appeal from Netanyahu for Knesset members to show responsibility and restraint.'Most sensitive kilometer on Earth'Netanyahu is walking a fine line between supporting the existing right of Jews to visit (but not pray at) the Temple Mount and preventing that right from sparking a broader crisis and renewed violence. In a statement Sunday aimed as much at the likes of Feiglin as Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, he said the Temple Mount complex is ""the most sensitive kilometer on Earth,"" and insisted the government would not change the status quo.""It is easy to start a religious fire but much more difficult to extinguish it,"" Netanyahu said. On that note he and Abbas were in rare accord, the Palestinian President saying ""assaults and provocations by fanatics will lead to grave consequences.""Some commentators say Netanyahu is politically vulnerable on this issue. The Israeli right, and especially the Jewish Home Party led by Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, is growing in strength, according to opinion polls. Bennett -- a member of the Israeli cabinet -- argued for a tougher Gaza campaign aimed at destroying Hamas and is widely seen as Netanyahu's principal challenger. He told the Financial Times last month that ""the logic that the world will love us if we give up more land doesn't work"" and has pressed for more settlement construction. He also told CNN he supported the right of Jews to pray at the Temple Mount.The United States wants a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a meaningful d_tente with Iran, the Netanyahu government opposes both.Stephen M. WaltBy contrast, support for the centrist and leftist parties is dropping, while opposition to a two-state negotiated settlement is widespread. A poll this month for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs found that 75% of the Israeli Jews oppose Israel's withdrawal from the Jordan Valley and the division of Jerusalem, which would give the eastern half to the Palestinians.The volatility in Jerusalem has become the latest flashpoint in Israeli-Palestinian relations. The peace process is moribund amid an absence of trust between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority; much of Gaza is in ruins following seven weeks of conflict there this summer in which more than 2,000 people were killed.The European Union has questioned Israel's ""commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the Palestinians"" in the wake of renewed momentum in expanding Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem. The U.S. State Department made a similar criticism.In such an atmosphere, it is hardly surprising that U.S. efforts to promote dialogue have stumbled. Writing in Foreign Policy, Stephen M. Walt says that if you invest real effort in the peace process -- as have President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry ""and you get precisely zero help from Netanyahu and his lieutenants, a degree of irritation is to be expected.""""The United States wants a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a meaningful d_tente with Iran, the Netanyahu government opposes both,"" he added.The left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a cartoon showing a grinning Netanyahu piloting an Israeli plane whizzing toward a U.S. skyscraper. Responding to a furious reaction in social media, cartoonist Amos Biderman said: ""The message is that Bibi is arrogantly and wantonly destroying Israel's ties with the U.S.""From the other end of the political spectrum, journalist Caroline Glick wrote: ""While [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud] Abbas himself is responsible for the hit on [Yehuda] Glick, he has had one major enabler -- the Obama administration.""A Jerusalem Post poll at the weekend found that 53% of Israeli Jews now regarded the US administration as pro-Palestinian, with just 16% seeing it as pro-Israel. Responding to disparaging remarks made about him by unidentified U.S. officials last week, Netanyahu sought to turn the criticism to his advantage, saying ""the assault on me comes only because I defend the state of Israel.""But that doesn't include changing the delicate status quo on the Temple Mount and inviting yet more violence at the end of a year already full of bloodshed.",cnn,0.4"Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell is pulling away from Democratic challenger Alison Lundergran Grimes in the final stretch of this hard-fought race, polls show, as the incumbent looks to not only lock up a sixth term but also ascend to majority leader if his party takes the Senate.The bitter rivals, though, havenÍt stopped campaigning and are riding hard to the finish in a race punctuated by nasty disagreements _ most recently, over a Republican campaign mailer that GrimesÍ camp is calling a tool to scare voters.ñThis is rock bottom,î Grimes told a crowd in Lebanon, Ky., Sunday night. ñThis is desperation. This is a scare tactic. This is voter intimidation. This is wrong.îThe GOP mailer has the words, ñElection Violation Notice,î in all caps across the front. It goes on to essentially accuse Grimes of spreading ñfraudulent informationî to voters.McConnell over the weekend defended the flier, which his campaign authorized, calling it ñabsolutely appropriate.îñIt just reflects what she's been doing on the air,î McConnell said Saturday, referring to the inside of the mailer, which defends him against Grimes' attack ads.Each side is putting out controversial fliers in the final stretch. Another circulating from the state Democratic Party invoked race -- it features a black family and accuses McConnell of ñtargeting our president and the communityî and ñleading an effort to take away our right to vote.îThe McConnell campaign called it a ñreckless attempt to sow racial division among Kentuckians with false information.îBut Grimes defended the mailer and told Fox News that McConnellÍs record speaks for itself.ñHe is the one that's voted against felons actually receiving re-enfranchisement,î Grimes said. ñHe's the one that has actually proposed government-issued IDs at the polls.îThe Real Clear Politics average of polls shows McConnell with more than a 7-point lead. The Rothenberg Political Report also moved the race from ñlean Republicanî to ñRepublican favored,î and an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed McConnell has hit 50 percent and opened up a 9-point lead on Grimes.McConnell has been preparing for this battle for a long time and has hammered a simple message about his opponent. He has dismissed Grimes as an inexperienced rubberstamp for the failed Obama agenda, on everything from ObamaCare to energy policies and the economy to national security.ñA new face to do what,î McConnell said Saturday in Mt. Sterling, Ky. ñA new face to vote for the president's agenda. A new face for Harry Reid for majority leader of the Senate. She's a new face for the status quo.îGrimes consistently has slammed McConnell as a right-wing Washington obstructionist in the pockets of big corporate interests.ñMitch McConnell thinks we can't live without his seniority,î said Grimes. ñSeniority might be worth something if our senator wasn't up for sale from the highest bidder.îDemocrats have poured millions of dollars into the state to defeat McConnell, who isnÍt popular there -- but neither is President Obama, whose approval ratings are even lower.Grimes brought the race close at one point, but made a few rookie mistakes along the way.She has refused to say whether she voted for Obama despite having been a delegate for him at the 2012 Democratic National Convention that nominated him. Some voters saw it as awkward pandering by just another politician.Grimes emerged as a candidate after Hollywood star Ashley Judd balked at taking on McConnell.With the help of GrimesÍ father Jerry, an influential former two-term state Democratic Party chairman, she ran unopposed for her partyÍs nomination.McConnell's aides, who've been building his ground game all year, tell Fox News his reelection and the GOP majority are all but locked up. Though Democrats dispute this, this would put him in line to helm the Senate for at least the next two years.ñThese people in the White House need to be stopped,î McConnell proclaimed Saturday. He said thereÍs nobody he wants more to have a bad night Tuesday than Obama.According to sources, McConnell has been quietly plotting a strategy for a GOP Senate majority with colleagues and aides for months. If Republicans control Congress, McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, may be able to hammer out some compromises with Obama.But the 2016 presidential race limits the window of opportunity to the first six-to-eight months of next year. After that, the race to succeed Obama will make doing business while heÍs around all but impossible.With that calendar in mind, top Republican staffers say to expect to hear from a couple of ad hoc bipartisan ñgangsî with various options for deals the president might sign should the GOP control both sides of the Capitol.Lawmakers in both parties want to move energy legislation, secure the border and strengthen national and economic security.Sources also say that Democrats in competitive states, win or lose, have validated the GOP criticism of the Obama agenda on issues including guns, Keystone XL Pipeline and national security policy, which includes Syria, the Islamic State, Vladimir Putin, Ebola and more.McConnell also would go after the Affordable Care Act, but not immediately. Whatever the House of Representatives passes to reform or repeal the law would likely need to be watered down to get through the Senate. Should this happen, it is expected Obama would veto the first few bills to reach his desk, recognizing McConnell is prepared to bide his time.Still, if a Republican-controlled Congress passes bills next year with a few Democratic votes and the president doesn't sign them, the GOP 2016 field could look stronger. In turn, Democratic White House hopefuls, including Hillary Clinton, would either have to side with or against Obama as they run to replace him.",fox,0.7"While all the pre-Election Day chatter centers on whether Republicans will retake the Senate, the bigger question is: If they succeed, what will they do with the power?More than bragging rights are on the line. Important debates over issues ranging from immigration to the Keystone Pipeline to IranÍs nuclear program to taxes _ perhaps even parts of ObamaCare -- remain unresolved heading into President ObamaÍs final two years in office.  The balance of power in Congress could shape all of them, in the relatively narrow window before 2016 politics grind everything, once again, to a halt.Should Mitch McConnell both survive his general election challenge and ascend to majority leader _ with his party holding the House majority, as it most likely will _ Republicans would find themselves in an enviable position. TheyÍd have the obvious perks of majority-hood, able to pressure the administration with investigations and hearings from both chambers; to hold up Obama nominees to key appointments even more; and, when able to cobble together a filibuster-proof majority, to pass bills and repeal laws of their choosing, if only to force the president to employ his veto pen.  But thereÍs also the possibility that a Washington with power so evenly divided could yield some key agreements, in the spirit of the Gingrich-Clinton era. Or at least, could compel the president to dial back his approach in the final two years.Conservatives are gleeful at the prospect of full control of one branch of government.ñThis is an opportunity for the Republican Party to demonstrate that it has a governing agenda,î said Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative Heritage Action for America. ñAmericans think the whole system in Washington is broke. This is [RepublicansÍ] time to change that bad perception _ not only of Washington, but of the Republican Party."" On immigration, for example, a big Republican win could set up a standoff with Obama as he prepares to move forward on some type of major executive action. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the White House is weighing criteria for letting up to 4 million illegal immigrants stay in the country.All of this could easily come during the lame-duck session.Republicans, though, are eager to be in a position where they can challenge or undermine this action, even after the fact. Republican senators who were involved in crafting bipartisan immigration legislation in 2013 wrote a letter to the president last Thursday saying that ñ[executive action] would be the most divisive action you could take _ completely undermining any good-faith effort to meaningfully address this important issue.îHoller said conservative senators like TexasÍ Ted Cruz and others might try to reverse the presidentÍs actions through the appropriations process. As for more comprehensive legislative reform, the prospect of a mass deportation reprieve _ which critics call blanket ñamnestyî _ has complicated the debate, likely no matter which party is in control.ñThere are things Republicans would broadly agree to, but the problem is itÍs such a toxic environment,î Holler said. ñWhen amnesty is part of the equation it makes anything you want done impossible.îSome analysts believe that there are some issues that carry less political recoil _ at least for the president and moderates in both parties _ that might see a chance for reconciliation under a new Republican majority. There are enough overlapping interests in tax reform, pending trade agreements, infrastructure spending, and maybe even the Keystone Pipeline, which has been a political hot potato for six years.The administration consistently has delayed a decision on the pipeline, which would take as much as 830,000 barrels per day of Alberta tar sands crude to refineries on Texas' Gulf Coast. Both sides of the contentious issue have used it as a wedge in the midterm campaigns.So far, Senate Democrats have staved off any binding legislation that would green-light the pipeline (in 2013 the Senate passed a non-binding resolution in favor of Keystone). That might change in January if Republicans take control. At that point, the president might have to negotiate, perhaps as part of some broader energy legislation that gives Democrats and their environmental interests some grist, like increased coal emission standards.ñIt all depends on what [Obama] gets out of it,î said Sean Evans, chairman of the political science department at TennesseeÍs Union University. ñItÍs all about making sure both Republicans and Obama can claim a win.îA Republican majority also could cause problems for the administrationÍs negotiations with Iran, as a GOP-controlled Senate would be in a position to lead the charge on a bipartisan sanctions bill and make noise should the administration try initially to circumvent Congress on a nuclear pact.Analysts differ on how much the GOP could push through and how they might do it if they win the majority. The 2016 presidential election and even that yearÍs Senate elections would color most legislative debates. A number of senators are showing interest in running for the White House _ including Sens. Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Cruz _ which complicates the picture even more.Further, most polls indicate that if Republicans win the Senate, theyÍd only have a slim majority. (Democrats now hold a 55-45 majority, with two Independents caucusing with them.)Conservatives say Republicans in the Senate ñshould stand for something,î and even with a slight advantage use the ability to bring bills to the floor to introduce measures that would both show they can govern, and raise ideological issues to help differentiate themselves from their opponents whether legislation passes or not.ñThey will have two years to prove they arenÍt just anti-Obama, but even so, they can still make political stands,î said Craig Shirley, a Reagan biographer and longtime conservative strategist.ñThey should definitely raise immigration, corruption, tax reform, government reform, defunding some left-wing institutions _ that will bring them together at the very least,î he said. ñIf they canÍt get anything passed legislatively, at least it will make a political point.îThe last time a Democrat was in the White House with two Republican-controlled chambers was when President Bill Clinton was in office. Political historians give him credit for negotiating a number of Republican initiatives, including welfare reform. Some wonder if Obama has the same kind of political savvy _ or inclination -- to pull the same thing off today.ñClinton is the most brilliant politician in my lifetime,î said Peter Burns, political science professor at Loyola University. ñI donÍt know if Obama has the ability to do that.î Plus, he added, ñBill Clinton was one of the few presidents who got more popular over time. Obama is down very low right nowî and not in the best negotiating position.Though an all-Republican majority on Capitol Hill would no doubt frustrate Obama, there is one potential bright spot for him. To date, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has blocked a vote on legislation to give the president special authority to negotiate certain trade deals, worried about the impact on U.S. jobs. But Obama wants that authority for a potential Asia-Pacific trade pact _ and Republicans might be willing to give it to him.Meanwhile, Holler said Heritage Action will encourage Republicans to ñfocus on the big things,î like repealing ObamaCare, rather than chipping away at the law by overturning its more unpopular measures, like the medical device tax, or finding common ground in the appropriations process. He is undeterred by reports that even McConnell believes repeal is dead in the water.He and other conservatives believe they should fight for it, and other issues _ like tax reform or entitlement reform _ that will show clear alternatives to the DemocratsÍ platform. ñThey can play small ball and do some of these small things and draw contrasts a little, but thatÍs not why people are going to say, 'letÍs give you another chance',î he said. ñTheyÍre going to give you another chance when they see a big agenda.î",fox,0.7"Al Qaeda-tied fighters reportedly overran Western-backed Syrian rebels in key strongholds over the weekend and threatened to advance deeper into their territory on Monday, dealing a blow to the Obama administrationÍs efforts to train and equip moderate opposition forces.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted Monday that the mission to prop up a competent Syrian fighting force will take time, and is ñnot a short-term proposition.îñThis is going to require a sustained effort and a sustained commitment,î Earnest said.But the reported advances by the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front underscored the weakness of the fighters America hopes can act as a de facto ground force in Syria against the Islamic State.The Washington Post reported that U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army rebels surrendered or defected as Nusra fighters trampled towns and communities in the province of Idlib.The Associated Press reports that the Nusra fighters have since amassed near the border town of Bab al-Hawa.The Nusra Front and the Islamic State are bitter rivals, and there was no evidence that the two acted in unison in the latest push. It appeared the Nusra Front sought to control a key supply line to the Syrian rebels fighting against President Bashar Assad's rule.The Syrian rebels, though, are a key plank of the WestÍs strategy, together with airstrikes and cooperation from regional partners, to defeat the Islamic State in Syria.A former military intelligence officer who keeps ties to Free Syrian Army commanders told Fox News that Nusra fighters have indeed made these advances against Syrian rebels in Idlib. The source told Fox News he has spoken with his contacts in Idlib about the developments, and that the defeats in Idlib leave the major city of Aleppo as ñthe last hope for the Free Syrian Army.îThe former military intelligence official said if the U.S. wants to support the Free Syrian Army there, ñit must go after Assadî _ whose forces have a large presence in Aleppo.""Aleppo is increasingly turning into a last stand, just like the Alamo,î the source said.Defense sources downplayed the reports of Nusra gains.One senior Defense official said they were ñnot tracking anything as big or catastrophicî as reported in the Post article.ñThere are ïbattlesÍ all the time between these groups, and we've yet to see anything I would characterize this way,î the source said. ñTerritory trades hands in local areas many times, and it is sometimes talked about in exaggerated terms to build propaganda.""Earnest said he could not confirm the reports and said the administration is still assessing the situation.ñWe certainly are aware that moderate forces in Syria are engaged in a multi-front conflict, and that multi-front conflict is taking a toll on them,î he said. ñThereÍs no doubt about that.îEarnest renewed calls to ñramp upî training and assistance to these forces.Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, said the Idlib province was a ""core stronghold"" for the Western-backed groups ""and they have been most definitively defeated in a few days.""""It's very significant."" Lister said. ""It shows that ... the moderates are weaker than what we have been led to believe, despite increased funding from the West.""Amid the advances by Nusra, the Islamic State group has been focused on trying to seize the eastern Syrian border town of Kobani from Kurdish fighters for more than a month. A U.S.-led coalition targeting the extremists launched four airstrikes Sunday and Monday, targeting its fighters near Kobani and one near Dayr Az Zawr, U.S. Central Command said.Nusra fighters are said to be gathering in the town of Sarmada in the northern Idlib province, a few miles from Bab al-Hawa.The Bab al-Hawa crossing is held by a rebel alliance known as the Islamic Front, and it is an important supply route for Western-backed fighters as well as aid groups to reach residents of northern Syria.Lister said he did not believe Nusra fighters would attack the crossing, saying they were unlikely to directly challenge the Islamic Front, a collection of hard-line and moderate Muslim groups. ""Most likely, they will seek to consolidate their influence in the area around Bab al-Hawa,"" he said.The recent defeats were a sharp blow for the Western-backed Syrian Revolutionaries Front, headed by prominent commander Jamal Maarouf, and Harakat Hazm, a group armed and funded by the U.S. _ both are part of the Free Syrian Army alliance.  Harakat Hazm emerged earlier this year and online videos have showed its fighters using Western-donated weapons, including U.S. anti-tank weapons in the spring. It has made modest advances in Idlib.But the U.S. aid never increased and it couldn't compete with stronger militant groups, Lister said.",fox,0.7"The State Department insisted Wednesday that an internal memo that pushed for bringing non-American Ebola patients to the U.S. for treatment was written by a ñmidlevel officialî and does not reflect the administrationÍs plans.Spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated the department stance that there are ñno plansî to airlift non-Americans with Ebola out of West Africa and bring them to the United States.

The memo recommended that ñState and DHS devise a system for expeditious parole of Ebola-infected non-citizens into the United States as long as they are otherwise eligible for medical evacuation from the Ebola affected countries and for entry into the United States.îThe memo was obtained after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson a week ago asking if either department was formulating a plan to allow non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to come to the U.S. for medical treatment.Goodlatte blasted the administration on Wednesday for the memo.ñItÍs alarming that senior Obama administration officials so vehemently denied the existence of any plans to transport non-U.S. citizens infected with Ebola to the United States for treatment when a leaked State Department document shows that such a proposal indeed exists and was approved by Obama administration officials,î he said in a statement. ñThe internal memo shows that this proposal was approved by several people at the State Department, and possibly even by the official leading the Ebola Coordination Unit at the agency. Unfortunately, this lack of transparency is just another example of the Obama Administration trying to hide its actions from the American people.îBut Psaki said that document is ñweeks oldî and never went anywhere inside the State Department.ñThe document referenced was drafted by a mid-level official but not cleared by senior leaders. It never came to senior officials for approval and any assertion that the memo was cleared by decision makers is inaccurate. There are no plans to medevac non-Americans who become ill with Ebola to the United States,î she said. Psaki said ñit's sitting on a shelf or on a computer.î",fox,0.7"Private spaceflight company Orbital Sciences Corp. is starting to piece together the timeline of events leading up to the explosion of its Antares rocket just after liftoff on Tuesday evening (Oct. 28).Orbital Sciences is still in the process of investigating the root cause of the Antares rocket failure. No one was hurt in the explosion, but the rocket was carrying an unmanned Cygnus spacecraft expected to deliver supplies to the International Space Station for NASA when the accident occurred. According to an Orbital update released Thursday (Oct. 30), the rocket seemed to perform normally until about 15 seconds after launch, when some as-yet-unknown variable caused the rocket to catastrophically fail.""Evidence suggests the failure initiated in the first stage after which the vehicle lost its propulsive capability and fell back to the ground impacting near, but not on, the launch pad,"" Orbital Sciences representatives wrote in an update. The rocket was launching from a pad at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. [See images of the Antares explosion]Orbital Sciences holds a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to fly eight robotic missions to the International Space Station using Cygnus and Antares. The launch Tuesday (if it had been successful) would have started the company's third official resupply trip to the station.Company representatives are also surveying the damage caused by the accident. An Orbital safety team found that a ""significant amount of debris"" is still located around the site of the failure, and the company might be able to use that evidence to aid in their investigation, Orbital representatives said.""Some of the Cygnus cargo has also been found and will be retrieved as soon as we have clearance to do so to see if any survived intact,"" Orbital representatives said in the same update. ""After up close visual inspections by the safety team, it still appears the launch site itself avoided major damage. There is some evidence of damage to piping that runs between the fuel and commodity storage vessels and the launch mount, but no evidence of significant damage to either the storage vessels or launch mount.""Crewmembers on the space station still have plenty of supplies on the orbiting laboratory, so there is no immediate danger posed by the Cygnus loss, NASA officials have said.The space station astronauts have had to rearrange some of their plans in light of the rocket failure, however. Officials with the European Space Agency said there will now be a need to alter how trash is stored in Europe's Columbus module on the station.Cygnus spacecraft are designed to burn up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere after leaving the space station at the end of missions, meaning that astronauts can load the spacecraft up with things they no longer need.""The unglamorous fact is that we now need to rework our trash and stowage choreography for Columbus,"" ESA officials wrote in an Oct. 30 blog post. ""We had a strategy in place to operate efficiently but now we have to work with the trash we cannot get rid of with Orbital-3!""Editor's Note: NASA officials are urging residents of the area around the launch site to keep away from any rocket debris that might wash up on shore or found on land.

The Monroe County Sheriff's Office posted another picture earlier in the week that showed the missing woman, Chelsea Bruck, in costume and smiling with five other people. The nine party-goers in the three photos have all been identified, according to the Monroe County SheriffÍs office, but Bruck is still nowhere to be found.Bruck got separated from her friends at the Halloween bash on Oct. 25 and hasnÍt been heard from since, according to NBC affiliate WDIV. She was wearing a Batman-inspired ñPoison Ivyî costume comprised of black yoga pants and a leaf-covered green top, according to police. Her naturally blonde hair was colored purple. Volunteers and investigators have been scouring Monroe all week, fueled by tips on the ñHelp Find Chelsea Bruckî Facebook page, and leads called into police. The community has also rallied around the Bruck family by setting up a donation page and organizing a Monday night prayer vigil, according to Redeemer Fellowship Church in Monroe. ñWe just want her back,î BruckÍs mother Leannda Bruck told WDIV. ñWe just want her safe.î",msnbc,0.6"SpaceShipTwo's unique tail section, which can ""feather"" at an angle to help the Virgin Galactic spacecraft make a safe descent, unfurled as it was ascending during the flight that ended in a fatal breakup Friday and without being ordered to do so, federal investigators said Sunday night.The ""feathering"" mechanism isn't supposed to be unlocked until the spacecraft reaches 1.4 times the speed of sound, Christopher Hart, the NTSB's acting chairman, said at a news conference. But on the flight that crashed Friday, co-pilot Michael Alsbury moved the mechanism's lock-unlock lever into the unlocked position earlier, at just slightly above Mach 1, Hart said.The feathering procedure is supposed to require two separate steps to engage: First, the pilots must unlock the feather mechanism; then they must move a separate feather handle into position. SpaceShipTwo's feather mechanism began moving almost immediately „ even though neither pilot took that second step, Hart said. That would have increased the plane's atmospheric drag at just the wrong moment.""Two seconds later, we saw disintegration,"" Hart said. Almost immediately, telemetry and video data ""terminated,"" he said.Image: Feathered wings CLAY CENTER OBSERVATORY / VIRGIN GALACTIC FILEA long-range telescopic photo from May 2011 shows the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane with its wings in the bent, ""feathered"" position. The orientation of the wings is supposed to help keep the plane in a stable position during its descent through the atmosphere. The term ""feathered"" is used because the configuration is reminiscent of a badminton shuttlecock with feathers.Alsbury was killed as a result of the in-flight breakup. The rocket plane's pilot, Pete Siebold, parachuted to the ground, suffered injuries and is now hospitalized. Friends of Alsbury have established a memorial fund.Hart offered no explanations for why the tail mechanism moved prematurely, but the information disclosed Sunday is likely to shift the focus of the investigation from the plane's hybrid rocket motor to its feathering mechanism.Hart said the motor and the fuel tanks survived intact, which will help the investigation significantly. Still, Hart said that ""there's much more that we don't know"" and that ""we are a long way from finding the cause."" He emphasized that he was only reporting facts that had been gathered to date and not any conclusions as to the accident's cause.",msnbc,0.6"If tea party firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz has his way, a Republican takeover of the Senate after TuesdayÍs midterm elections would give rise to an aggressive new GOP, empowering the party to go on the offensive against President Barack Obama and ultimately repeal the Affordable Care Act.In a weekend interview with The Washington Post in Anchorage, Alaska, where the Texas senator spent the final weekend ahead of the midterms campaigning for fellow Republican Dan Sullivan, Cruz said he plans to push hard for a Republican-led Senate to be as conservative and confrontational as the GOP-led House. SullivanÍs race is considered pivotal as the party looks to win control of both chambers.Should Republicans gain control of the Senate from Democrats after the elections on Tuesday, Cruz said the first task should be a series of hearings on Obama, ñlooking at the abuse of power, the executive abuse, the regulatory abuse, the lawlessness that sadly has pervaded this administration,î the Post reported. Senators, he added, should be as aggressive as their counterparts in the House in trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Cruz filibustered the health care law for more than 21 hours last September, and was criticized for the 16-day federal government shutdown that followed his stunt. The GOP-led House has voted more than 50 times to dismantle the law.Asked whether he would support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as Majority leader, Cruz declined to endorse the Kentucky Republican, which could signal a strategy to expand his influence in the Senate as he considers a campaign for president in 2016.CruzÍs larger ambitions were also on display last week, when he took a direct swing at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He implied Bush would lose if he decides to run for president in 2016. Cruz _ who presents a radical alternative to more mainstream possibilities like Bush or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie _ has implied that nominating a moderate GOP leader in the next presidential election would be dangerous for the party.But some people argue the Republican candidates running this week are as extreme as ever. Joni Ernst, who is campaigning for the Senate in Iowa, once said she carries a gun to defend herself from the government. In Colorado, Cory Gardner claimed that he didnÍt support a Personhood effort to ban abortion, despite the existence of video footage.Esquire magazine last month interviewed 90 members of the House and Senate and asked them to identify problems in Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle agreed that Cruz is an issue. When the U.S. Supreme Court in October declined to take up same-sex marriage cases in multiple states by putting the responsibility on lower courts, most of the GOP leadership remained silent. Cruz, in typical fashion, called the highest courtÍs choice ñjudicial activism at its worst.î",msnbc,0.6"Even after six years, President ObamaÍs loudest critics canÍt quite decide what it is about him they donÍt like. That wouldnÍt necessarily be a problem were it not for the fact that so many of their condemnations contradict each other. The list is likely familiar to regular readers. HeÍs a ruthless Chicago thug and a ñwuss.î HeÍs sticking to the Bush/Cheney script on national security and heÍs putting us at risk by abandoning the Bush/Cheney national security agenda. HeÍs cutting cherished entitlement programs like Medicare and he refuses to cut entitlement programs like Medicare. HeÍs waging a class war against the rich and heÍs coddling millionaires. But the one contradiction Republicans _ and much of the Beltway media _ find most exciting is the notion that Obama is a bystander, who sits around and watches events pass him by, and a tyrannical activist, who acts unilaterally and tries to seize control of all federal power. All of which brings us to this amazing report from Ben Terris on Joni ErnstÍs (R) right-wing U.S. Senate candidacy in Iowa. It was Ernst who famously referred to President Obama as an overzealous ñdictatorî who is constantly ñoverstepping his bounds.î And now itÍs Ernst whoÍs convinced Obama is ñan apathetic president,î reluctant to do any work at all.After the event, Ernst elaborated without elucidating exactly what she meant. ñHe is just standing back and letting things happen, he is reactive rather than proactive,î she said. ñWith Ebola, heÍs been very hands off.î ñWhat should he have done about Ebola?î Esquire blogger Charlie Pierce asked her. ñOne person in America has Ebola.î ñOK, youÍre the press, youÍre giving me your opinion,î Ernst said.LetÍs stop right there. For one thing, itÍs not ñopinionî that thereÍs one person in America with Ebola. For another, thereÍs simply no sane way to characterize ObamaÍs response to the Ebola threat as ñhands off.î I realize that Ernst has struggled routinely with the basics of current events, but this is plainly ridiculous.ñBut he is the leader, he is the leader of our nation,î she said. ñSo what he can do is make sure that all of these agencies are coordinating together, to make sure he is sharing with the American people he cares about them, he cares about their safety.î ñYou donÍt think he does?î he said. ñI donÍt know that he does, he hasnÍt demonstrated that,î she said. ñYou donÍt think heÍs demonstrated that he cares about the American people?î he said. ñHe hasnÍt,î she said.Yes, weÍve reached the point at which Obama is a bleeding-heart liberal, who cares too much about people, and a callous brute, indifferent towards people. As for the White House making sure ñall of these agencies are coordinating together,î and communicating with the public, thatÍs exactly what the president and his team have been doing for quite a while. If Ernst doesnÍt know this, why is she commenting on a major national issue she knows so little about? And if Ernst does know this, why is she saying the opposite of whatÍs true?[A]sked to reconcile the two thoughts, that she thinks he acts both like a dictator and somebody who doesnÍt even care enough to act, this is what she said: ñThatÍs where he is a leader. So many of the actions that he proposes taking are actions that should be done by Congress. Not by the president. He is our executive. He is our leader. He is our president. Congress should be making the legislative actions.îOh, I see. Joni Ernst wants Obama to lead more and lead less. She wants him to be more proactive without Congress and more reactive waiting for Congress. SheÍs looking for him to do exactly what heÍs already done, but Ernst pretends not to notice. And she apparently thinks the count of Ebola patients is ñopinion.î There are lots of low-information voters. Joni Ernst is a rare example of a low-information Senate candidate.",msnbc,0.6"There has been no Todd Akin in this election cycle _ that is, there are no ñgaffesî that have elucidated an extreme position in a particularly meme-friendly way the way the infamous ñlegitimate rapeî comment did _ only those same extreme positions cast in soothingly moderate language. But that doesnÍt mean that womenÍs reproductive rights arenÍt on the ballot across the country anyway, both implicitly and explicitly. HereÍs a guide.Ballot measures: Both Colorado and North Dakota have Personhood amendments _ granting fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses full citizenship rights _ on the ballot in one form or another. As long as Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, a Personhood amendment canÍt ban abortion, but there is no current constitutional protection for in-vitro fertilization processes or, for that matter, the IUD and the morning-after pill, which Personhood proponents believe to be abortion, among other contraceptives.ItÍs PersonhoodÍs third time on the ballot in Colorado, and itÍs gotten savvier about its wording with Amendment 67. The question on the ballot is about ñprotecting pregnant women and unborn children by defining ïpersonÍ and ïchildÍ in the Colorado criminal code and the Colorado wrongful death act to include unborn human beings.î Left unsaid: That pregnant women themselves could be prosecuted for endangering an embryo or fetus, or even for a suspect miscarriage.In North Dakota, voters will vote on amending the constitution to include ñthe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.î Just what ñat any stage of developmentî means has been hotly debated. Some critics contend that in addition to intending to ban abortion, it would also override advanced directives for end-of-life care, forcing the dying to stay on life support against their wishes. Polling conducted in late October found 45% of voters opposed the measure, with 16% undecided.Related: New War on Women Coming?TennesseeÍs ballot measure sounds more obscure but is likely more immediately consequential. It seeks to override a 2000 Tennessee Supreme Court decision that read a strong privacy protection in the state constitution, safeguarding against abortion restrictions the legislature has long clamored to pass. There is some more confusing wording here: The amendment stipulates that the constitution doesnÍt require ñthe funding of an abortion,î but Tennessee already has no Medicaid-funded abortions except in cases of rape and incest. It also mentions ñcircumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the motherî _ but what it is actually saying is that these exceptions, popular with voters, wonÍt necessarily be included in any future law. Abortion opponentsÍ ads have focused on Tennessee as an ñabortion destinationî and ñabortion tourism,î because Tennessee puts fewer burdens on women seeking abortions than other states _ notably neighboring Mississippi, where there is only one clinic left. The recent polling on the amendment indicates that itÍs too close to call.Control of the U.S. Senate: If, as polls suggest, Republicans have a good night on Tuesday, it wonÍt mean too much for actual legislation in the short term, given that Obama has a veto pen for two more years. But it could have a sweeping impact on the federal courts, whose judges are confirmed by the Senate. These judges are usually the ones interpreting the hundreds of abortion restrictions passed by state legislatures _ the judges who oversee Texas, for example, have said the state can do basically anything to stand in an abortion patientÍs way, including shutting down dozens of clinics.  University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone estimates that as many 90 judicial appointments will open up in the next two years. ñIf the Republicans control the Senate,î he wrote, ñyou can be sure that many fewer Obama nominees will be confirmed, and that those who do win confirmation will be much less progressive than the judges this White House has managed to appoint in its first six years.îControl of state legislatures: In 2010, Republicans capturing total control of state legislatures helped usher in a record number of restrictions on abortion. A few more closely-divided states are still within Republican sights for Tuesday, Kentucky, Iowa, and New Hampshire among them. Kentucky, where Republicans control the state Senate but not the House, is particularly vulnerable, because a veto from the governor, currently a Democrat, can be overridden by a simple majority.GovernorÍs races: Wisconsin governor and presidential hopeful Scott Walker has tried to gloss over his stances and policy moves restricting womenÍs rights, including abortion access. HeÍs in a tight race against his pro-choice opponent, Mary Burke. In Colorado, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez has falsely claimed the IUD, a common form of birth control, is abortion. In Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, who has signed several abortion restrictions into law, is defending his seat against pro-choice Jason Carter. In Pennsylvania, incumbent Governor Tom Corbett, who famously defended a forced-ultrasound-before-abortion law by saying women could just close their eyes, looks likely to fall to pro-choice Democrat Tom Wolf. If Martha Coakley loses her race for governor in Massachusetts, pro-choice voters can console themselves with the fact that Republican Charlie Baker splits with his party on the issue.",msnbc,0.6"The Bivalvia, in previous centuries referred to as the Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda, comprise a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts. They have no head, and they also lack a radula. Bivalves include clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, and well as a number of families that live in freshwater. The majority are filter feeders. The gills have evolved into ctenidia, specialised organs for feeding and breathing. Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment, where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. A few bore into wood, clay or stone and live inside these substances. Some bivalves, such as the scallops, can swim.The shell of a bivalve is composed of calcium carbonate, and consists of two, usually similar, parts called valves. These are joined together along one edge (the hinge line) by a flexible ligament that, usually in conjunction with interlocking ""teeth"" on each of the valves, forms the hinge. This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves becoming disarticulated. The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical, with the hinge lying in the sagittal plane. Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length, but the majority of species do not exceed 10 cm (4 in).Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in saltwater and freshwater) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.Bivalves appear in the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is approximately 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine bivalves (including brackish water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which is the Unionidae, with about 700 species.Contents  [hide] 1 Etymology2 Anatomy2.1 Mantle and shell2.2 Nervous system2.2.1 Senses2.3 Muscles2.4 Circulation and respiration2.5 Digestive system2.5.1 Modes of feeding2.5.2 Digestive tract2.6 Excretory system2.7 Reproduction and development3 Comparison with brachiopods4 Evolutionary history5 Diversity of extant bivalves6 Distribution7 Behaviour7.1 Predators and defence8 Mariculture9 Use as food9.1 Viral and bacterial infections9.2 Paralytic shellfish poisoning9.3 Amnesic shellfish poisoning10 Use in controlling pollution11 Other uses11.1 Pearls and mother-of-pearl11.2 Symbolism12 Bivalvian taxonomies12.1 Practical taxonomy of R.C. Moore12.2 1935 taxonomy12.3 Taxonomy based upon hinge tooth morphology12.4 Taxonomy based upon gill morphology12.5 2010 taxonomy13 References14 Further readingEtymology[edit]The taxonomic term Bivalvia was first used by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 to refer to animals having shells composed of two valves.[3] More recently, the class was known as Pelecypoda, meaning ""axe-foot"" (based on the shape of the foot of the animal when extended).The name ""bivalve"" is derived from the Latin bis, meaning ""two"", and valvae, meaning ""leaves of a door"".[4] Not all animals with shells with two hinged parts are classified under Bivalvia; other animals with paired valves include certain gastropods (small sea snails in the family Juliidae),[5] members of the phylum Brachiopoda [6] and the minute crustaceans known as ostracods[7] and conchostrachans.[8]Anatomy[edit]Freshwater pearl mussel anatomyDrawing of freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) anatomy: 1: posterior adductor, 2: anterior adductor, 3: outer gill demibranch, 4: inner gill demibranch, 5: excurrent siphon, 6: incurrent siphon, 7: foot, 8: teeth, 9: hinge, 10: mantle, 11: umboInterior of the left valve of a veneridInterior of the left valve of a veneridMain parts of a bivalve shellMain parts of a bivalve shell: 1: sagittal plane, 2: growth lines, 3: ligament, 4: umboBivalves vary greatly in overall shape. Some, such as the cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and straightening their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.[9]Mantle and shell[edit]Main article: Bivalve shellNear the hinge of the shell is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like protuberance usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.[10]In all molluscs, the mantle forms a thin membrane that covers the animal's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes. In bivalves, the mantle lobes secrete the valves, and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament, byssus threads (where present), and teeth.[11]Visible on the inside of most empty bivalve valves is a shiny curved line that runs more or less parallel to the outer margin of the shell and often connects the two adductor muscle scars (if the animal had two adductor muscles). This line (known as the pallial line) exists because, parallel to the opening edge of the bivalve's shell, the mantle is attached to the shell by a continuous narrow row of minute mantle retractor muscles. The function of these small muscles is to pull the loose edge of the mantle up out of harm's way when this is necessary because of minor predation attempts. In many bivalves, the mantle edges fuse at the posterior end of the shell to form two siphons, through one of which water is inhaled, and the other expelled, for respiration and suspension feeding.[10] There is often a pocket-like space into which the siphons fit when they are retracted. This is visible on the inside of the valve as an indentation on the pallial line which is known as the pallial sinus.[10]The shell is composed of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, as is the case in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, as is the case in the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down.[12] The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite.[12] The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which is composed of a horny organic substance. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded.[13] The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.[14]The shell is added to in two ways; the valves grow larger when more material is secreted by the mantle at the margin of the shell, and the valves themselves thicken gradually throughout the animal's life as more calcareous matter is secreted by the mantle lobes. Although the (sometimes faint) concentric rings on the exterior of a valve are commonly described as ""growth rings"" or ""growth lines"", a more accurate method for determining the age of a shell is by cutting a cross section through it and examining the incremental growth bands. Use of this technique has changed views on the longevity of many bivalves. For example, the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) was thought to be short-lived, but has now been shown to have a lifespan of at least 28 years.[15]The two valves of the bivalve shell are held together at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which are attached to the inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell there are in most cases a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.[16]Nervous system[edit]The sedentary habits of the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than it is in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network and a series of paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, there are two cerebropleural ganglia on either side of the oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle.[17] These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.[17]Senses[edit]The sensory organs of bivalves are not well developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species they fringe the entire mantle cavity.[18] The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with the structure of the same name found in snails and slugs.[19] Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detects the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity.[20][21] In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.[22]Many bivalves have no eyes, but a few members of Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photo-sensory cells and a lens.[23] Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina and a concave mirror.[24] All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.[17]Muscles[edit]The main muscular system in bivalves is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles may be reduced or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract in order to close the shell. They work in opposition to the ligament which tends to pull the valves apart.[16] In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, there is also a single, central adductor muscle.[13] These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibre, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.[13]The mantle suspender muscles attach the mantle to the shell and leave an arc-shaped scar on the inside of the valve, the pallial line. The paired pedal protractor and retractor muscles operate the animal's foot. Some bivalves, such as oysters and most scallops, are unable to extend their foot and in them, these muscles are absent. Other paired muscles control the siphons and the byssus.[10][13]Circulation and respiration[edit]Filaments from blue mussel gillsFour filaments of the gills of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) a) part of four filaments showing ciliated interfilamentar junctions (cj) b) diagram of a single filament showing the two lamellae connected at intervals by interlamellar junctions (ilj) and the position of the ciliated interfilamentar junctions (cp)Bivalves have an open circulatory system that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two auricles receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, and then to the rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.[25]Oxygen is absorbed into the hemolymph in the gills which provide the primary respiratory surface. The gills hang down into the mantle cavity, the wall of which provides a secondary respiratory surface being well supplied with capillaries. In species with no gills, such as the subclass Anomalodesmata, the wall of the mantle cavity is the only organ involved in respiration. Bivalves adapted to tidal environments can survive for several hours out of water by closing their shells tightly. Some freshwater species, when exposed to the air, can gape the shell slightly and gas exchange can take place.[26]The hemolymph usually lacks any respiratory pigment, although members of the families Arcidae and Limidae are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved directly into the serum.[20] In the carnivorous genus Poromya, the hemolymph has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin pigment.[27]Digestive system[edit]Modes of feeding[edit]Most bivalves are filter feeders, using their gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The Protobranchs feed in a different way, scraping detritus from the seabed, and this may be the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold onto the substratum with a pair of tentacles at the edge of the mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.[20]In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, water is drawn into the shell from the posterior ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in a steady stream of mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.[28]A few bivalves, such as the granular poromya (Poromya granulata), are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves. In these animals, the gills are relatively small, and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled. Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl-shaped organ, sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time. The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted, bringing the prey within reach of the mouth. The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested.[27]The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, being found only in the oesophagus of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.[29]Digestive tract[edit]The digestive tract of typical bivalves consists of an oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. A number of digestive glands open into the stomach, often via a pair of diverticula; these secrete enzymes to digest food in the stomach, but also include cells that phagocytose food particles, and digest them intracellularly. In filter-feeding bivalves, an elongated rod of solidified mucus referred to as the ""crystalline style"" projects into the stomach from an associated sac. Cilia in the sac cause the style to rotate, winding in a stream of food-containing mucus from the mouth, and churning the stomach contents. This constant motion propels food particles into a sorting region at the rear of the stomach, which distributes smaller particles into the digestive glands, and heavier particles into the intestine.[30] Waste material is consolidated in the rectum and voided as pellets into the exhalent water stream through an anal pore. Feeding and digestion are synchronized with diurnal and tidal cycles.[31]Carnivorous bivalves have a greatly reduced style, and a chitinous gizzard that helps grind up the food before digestion. In other ways their gut is similar to that of filter-feeding bivalves.[20]Excretory system[edit]Like most other molluscs, the excretory organs of bivalves are a pair of nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. There are also pericardial glands, either lining the auricles of the heart or attached to the pericardium, which serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings near the front of the upper part of the mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.[32]Reproduction and development[edit]The sexes are usually separate in bivalves but some hermaphroditism is known. The gonads are located close to the intestines, and either open into the nephridia, or through a separate pore into the mantle cavity.[33] The ripe gonads of male and females release sperm and eggs into the water column. Spawning may take place continually or be triggered by environmental factors such as day length, water temperature or the presence of sperm in the water. Some species are ""dribble spawners"" but others release their gametes in batches or all at once. Mass spawning events sometimes take place when all the bivalves in an area synchronise their release of spawn.[34]Fertilization is usually external. Typically, there is a short stage lasting a few hours or days before the eggs hatch into trochophore larvae. These later develop into veliger larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles that are sometimes (for example in the case of oysters) known as ""spat"".[33] In some species, such as those in the genus Lasaea, females draw water containing sperm in through their inhalant siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female. These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity, eventually releasing them into the water column as veliger larvae or as crawl-away juveniles.[35]Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in the water column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In temperate regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days they become D-stage larvae, the stage at which they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces ten times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed in order to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.[36]Freshwater bivalves in the order Unionoida have a different life cycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs is that they can disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.[37]Some of the species in the freshwater mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach for a closer look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.[38]Comparison with brachiopods[edit]Ark clam fossilAnadara, a bivalve with taxodont dentition from the Pliocene of CyprusBrachiopod fossilA fossil Jurassic brachiopod with the lophophore support intactBrachiopods are shelled marine organisms that superficially resembled bivalves in that they are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The differences between the two groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.[39]Both groups have a shell consisting of two valves, but the organization of the shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.[40]Evolutionary history[edit]The Cambrian explosion took place around 540 to 520 million years ago. In this geologically brief period all the major animal phyla diverged and these included the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time and left their fossilized remains behind in the rocks.[41]Possible early bivalves include Pojetaia and Fordilla; these probably lie in the stem rather than crown group. Only five genera of supposed Cambrian ""bivalve"" exist, the others being Tuarangia, Camya and Arhouriella and potentially Buluniella.[42] It has also been proposed that bivalves evolved from the Rostroconchs.Bivalve fossils are formed when the sediment in which the shells are buried hardens into rock. Often it is the impression made by the valves that remains as a fossil rather than the valves themselves. During the Early Ordovician there was a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species and the dysodont, heterodont and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods siphons first appeared which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.[43]By the middle of the Paleozoic, around 400 million years ago, the brachiopods were among the most abundant filter feeders in the ocean and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized.[44] By the Permian-Triassic extinction event 250 million years ago, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity.[40] Scientists have speculated that the ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators was a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.[43]It was for a long time thought that bivalves were better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, out-competing and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. But all this has been broadly disproven _ rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.[45]Diversity of extant bivalves[edit]The adult maximum size of living species of bivalve ranges from 0.52 mm (0.02 in) in Condylonucula maya,[46] a nut clam, to a length of 1,532 millimetres (60.3 in) in Kuphus polythalamia, an elongated, burrowing shipworm.[47] However, the species generally regarded as the largest living bivalve is the giant clam Tridacna gigas, which can grow to a length of 1,200 millimetres (47 in) and a weight of more than 200 kilograms (441 lbs).[48] The largest known extinct bivalve is a species of Platyceramus whose fossils measure up to 3,000 mm (118 in) in length.[49]In his 2010 treatise, Compendium of Bivalves, Markus Huber gives the total number of living bivalve species as about 9,200 combined in 106 families.[50] Huber states that the number of 20,000 living species, often encountered in literature, could not be verified and presents the following table to illustrate the known diversity:",wikipedia,0"One World Trade Center (also 1 World Trade Center or 1 WTC; the current building was dubbed the Freedom Tower during initial basework) is the name of two buildings. It most commonly refers to the primary building of the new World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City, and the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere.[11] The 94-story[8][5] supertall structure, which shares a name with the northern Twin Tower in the original World Trade Center that was destroyed in the September 11 attacks, stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center. The building is bordered to the west by West Street, to the north by Vesey Street, to the south by Fulton Street, and to the east by Washington Street. Construction on below-ground utility relocations, footings, and foundations for the building began on April 27, 2006.[12] On March 30, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed that the building would be known by its legal name, One World Trade Center, rather than the colloquial name, Freedom Tower.[1]The tower's steel structure topped out on August 30, 2012.[13][14] On May 10, 2013, the final component of the skyscraper's spire was installed, making One World Trade Center the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the world at the time by pinnacle height. Its spire allows the building to reach a symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m) in reference to the year of the United States Declaration of Independence.[15][16][17] It has been the tallest structure in New York City since April 30, 2012, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building.[18][19] The new World Trade Center complex, in which One World Trade Center opened on November 3, 2014,[2][5] will initially have three other high-rise office buildings, located along Greenwich Street, and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center, where the Twin Towers once stood.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The construction is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex during the attacks of September 11, 2001.[26][27]Contents  [hide] 1 Original building (1970_2001)1.1 Construction1.2 Existence1.3 Incidents1.4 September 11 attacks2 New building2.1 Planning and development2.2 Construction2.3 Estimated cost and funding2.4 Architecture and design2.4.1 Layout2.4.1.1 Design evolution2.4.1.2 Height2.4.2 Sustainability2.4.3 Safety and security2.4.3.1 Security features2.4.3.2 Incidents2.4.4 Controversy2.4.5 America's Response Monument2.5 Owners and tenants2.5.1 Current tenants2.5.2 Prospective tenants2.6 Key figures2.6.1 Larry Silverstein2.6.2 David Childs2.6.3 Daniel Libeskind2.6.4 Daniel and John Tishman2.6.5 Douglas and Jody Durst2.6.6 Port Authority construction workers3 See also4 Notes5 References6 Further reading7 External linksOriginal building (1970_2001)See also: World Trade CenterConstructionMain article: Construction of the World Trade Center1 World Trade Center under construction in 1971The construction of the World Trade Center, of which the Twin Towers (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project, spearheaded by David Rockefeller, to help revitalize Lower Manhattan.[28] The project was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki who came up with the specific idea for twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which oversee the Port Authority, agreed to support the World Trade Center project at the Radio Row site on the lower-west side of Manhattan.[29] To make the agreement acceptable to New Jersey, the Port Authority agreed to take over the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed as PATH), which brought commuters from New Jersey to the Lower Manhattan site.[30]The towers were designed as framed tube structures, which provided tenants with open floor plans, uninterrupted by columns or walls.[31][32] This was accomplished using numerous closely spaced perimeter columns to provide much of the strength to the structure, along with gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space to be freed up for use as office space by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the World Trade Center twin towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as the slurry wall for digging the foundation, and wind tunnel experiments.[33][34]The North Tower (One World Trade Center) began in August 1968; extensive use of prefabricated components helped to speed up the construction process. The first tenants moved into the North Tower in December 1970.[35][36] Later, four other low-level buildings were constructed as part of the World Trade Center in the 1970s.[37][38] A seventh building was constructed in the mid-1980s.[39][40]ExistenceWith the construction of Seven World Trade Center in the 1980s, the World Trade Center had a total of seven buildings, but the most notable were the main two towers built in the 1960s„One World Trade Center being the North Tower and Two World Trade Center being the South Tower.[41] Each stood over 1,350 feet (410 m) high, and occupied about 1 acre (4,000 m2) of the total 16 acres (65,000 m2) of the site's land. During a press conference in 1973, Yamasaki was asked, ""Why two 110-story buildings? Why not one 220-story building?"" His response was: ""I didn't want to lose the human scale.""[42]When completed in 1972, 1 World Trade Center became the tallest building in the world for two years, surpassing the Empire State Building after a 40-year reign. The North Tower stood 1,368 feet (417 m) tall and featured a telecommunications antenna or mast that was added at the top of the roof in 1978 and stood 360 feet (110 m) tall. With the 360-foot (110 m)-tall antenna/mast, the highest point of the North Tower reached 1,728 ft (527 m).[43] The World Trade Center towers held the height record only briefly: Chicago's Sears Tower, finished in May 1973, reached 1,450 feet (440 m) at the rooftop.[44] Throughout their existence the WTC towers had more floors (at 110) than any other building.[43] This number was not surpassed until the advent of the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010.[45][46]Of the 110 stories, eight were set aside for technical services in mechanical floors (floors 7/8, 41/42, 75/76, and 108/109), which were four two-floor areas that evenly spaced up the building. All the remaining floors were free for open-plan offices. Each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) of space for occupancy.[47] The tower, as well as its counterpart, had 3,800,000 square feet (350,000 m2) of office space in total.[47] Altogether, the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined 13,400,000 square feet (1,240,000 m2) of office space.[37][38] [48]Lobby of Tower 1, looking south along the east side of the building, August 19, 2000.Initially conceived as a complex dedicated to companies and organizations directly taking part in ""world trade"", it at first failed to attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center including the State of New York. It was not until the 1980s that the city's perilous financial state eased, after which an increasing number of private companies„mostly financial firms tied to Wall Street„became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex including many financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, Salomon Brothers and the Port Authority itself. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center,[49] along with a PATH station.[50] The North Tower became the home of the corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald,[51] and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[52]Electrical service to the tower was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800 volts. This service passed through the World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC) and sent up through the core of the building to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations stepped down the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277 volt secondary service, and then further down to 208/120 volt general power and lighting service. The complex also was served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of 5 WTC.[53][54]The 110th floor of 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower) housed radio and television transmission equipment. The roof of 1 WTC contained a vast array of transmission antennas including the 360 ft (approx 110 m) center antenna mast, rebuilt in 1999 by Dielectric Inc. to accommodate DTV.[55] The center mast contained the television signals for almost all NYC television broadcasters: WCBS-TV 2, WNBC-TV 4, WNYW 5, WABC-TV 7, WPIX 11, WNET 13 Newark, WPXN-TV 31 and WNJU 47 Linden.[55] It also had four NYC FM broadcasters: WPAT-FM 93.1, WNYC 93.9, WKCR 89.9, and WKTU 103.5.[55] Access to the roof was controlled from the WTC Operations Control Center (OCC) located in the B1 level of 2 WTC.[55] After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the equipment to broadcast the radio and television stations was moved to the Empire State Building.[56]On a typical weekday, a combined 50,000 people worked in the North and South towers[57] with another 200,000 passing through as visitors.[58] The complex was so large that it had its own zip code: 10048.[59] The Windows on the World restaurant, on top of the North Tower, reported revenues of US$37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States.[60] The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in numerous movies and television shows as well as on postcards and other merchandise, and came to be seen as a New York City icon, in the same league as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Statue of Liberty.[61]IncidentsOn February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the North Tower. Fire spread through the core to the 9th and 14th floors by igniting the insulation of telephone cables in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors. Areas at the furthest extent of the fire were extinguished almost immediately and the original fire was put out in a few hours.[62] Most of the damage was concentrated on the 11th floor, fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel[63] and there was no structural damage to the tower.[62] In addition to damage caused by the fire on the 9th_14th floors, water from the extinguishing of the fires damaged a few floors below. At that time, the World Trade Center had no fire sprinkler systems.[62]Underground bombing in 1993The first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17 p.m., when a Ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds (680 kg) of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower.[64] The blast opened a 100 foot (30 m) hole through five sublevels with the greatest damage occurring on levels B1 and B2 and significant structural damage on level B3.[65] Six people were killed, more than a thousand were injured, and 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time; many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that contained no emergency lighting, some taking two hours or more to reach safety.[66][67]September 11 attacksMain article: September 11 attacksSee also: Casualties of the September 11 attacks and New York City Fire Department casualties of the September 11 attacksImpact locations on 1 and 2 WTCThe remains of 6 World Trade Center, 7 World Trade Center, and 1 World Trade Center on September 17, 2001At 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001, five hijackers affiliated with al-Qaeda crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of 1 WTC.[68][69]After burning for 102 minutes, the North Tower collapsed at 10:28 a.m. due to structural failure.[70] When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7 WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising that building's structural integrity, and 7 WTC collapsed at 5:21 p.m.[71][72]The attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people, including the 19 hijackers and 2,977 victims.[73] Nearly all of the victims were civilians; 55 military personnel were among those killed at the Pentagon.[74] More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact.[75] In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell, or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided the complete destruction the rest of the building sustained.[76] The destruction of all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone, when Flight 11 hit, made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. One hundred and seven people below the point of impact died as well.[75]New buildingPlanning and developmentFollowing the destruction of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. Proposals for its reconstruction began almost immediately, and by 2003, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation organized a competition to determine how to use the site.[77] Public rejection of the first round of designs, the ""Preliminary Design Concepts"", led to a second, more open competition in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected. This went through many revisions, largely because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2001.[78]Criticism was leveled at the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan. Only 82 floors would have been habitable, and the overall office space of the entire rebuilt World Trade Center would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet (280,000 m2) in comparison with the original complex.[6] The floor limit was imposed by Silverstein, who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident. Much of the building's height would have consisted of a large, open-air steel lattice structure above the roof of the tower, containing wind turbines and ""sky gardens"".[6] In a subsequent design, the highest space that could be occupied became comparable to the original World Trade Center, and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans.[6] In 2002, former New York Governor George Pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect's bid picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor, Ron Lauder.[79]A final design for the ""Freedom Tower"" was formally unveiled on June 28, 2005. To satisfy security issues raised by the New York City Police Department, a 187-foot (57 m) concrete base was added in April of that year. The design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms to address criticism that it looked uninviting and resembled a ""concrete bunker"". However, this later proved unworkable, as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards. As a result, it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass.[80]Contrasting with Libeskind's original plan, the tower's final design tapers octagonally as it rises. Its designers stated that the tower would be a ""monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna."" Larry Silverstein commented in 2006 on a planned completion date: ""By 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt World Trade Center, more magnificent, more spectacular than it ever was.""[81] On April 26, 2006, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a conceptual framework that enabled foundation construction to begin, and a formal agreement was drafted on the following day, the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the Empire State Building. The tower's construction began in May with a formal ceremony that took place when the first construction team arrived.[82] The building's topping out occurred on August 31, 2012, and was completed on May 2, 2013.[80]In 2009 the Port Authority changed the official title of the building from ""Freedom Tower"" to ""One World Trade Center,"" stating that this name was the ""easiest for people to identify with.""[1][83] The change came after board members voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with Vantone Industrial Co., a Chinese real estate company, which will become the building's first commercial tenant. Vantone plans to create the China Center, a trade and cultural facility, covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69.[84]A report in September 2013 revealed that, at the time of the report, the World Trade Center Association (WTCA) continued to negotiate with the One World Trade Center in regard to the title ""World Trade Center"", as the WTCA purchased the rights to the name in 1986. The WTCA sought free office space in the tower worth US$500,000 in exchange for the use of ""World Trade Center"" on the One World Trade Center tower and associated souvenirs.[85]In May 2011, detailed floor plans of the tower were displayed on New York City's Department of Finance website, resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area, who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack.[86] In April 2012, with the tower's structure nearing completion, the owners of 1 WTC began a public marketing campaign for the building, seeking to draw in visitors and additional tenants.[87]On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) made the controversial[88] announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest building in the United States at 1,776 feet, declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture.[89][90]ConstructionMain article: Construction of One World Trade CenterOne World Trade Center tower construction as of August 7, 2007.The symbolic cornerstone of One World Trade Center was laid in a ceremony on July 4, 2004[91] (with an inscription supposedly by Arthur J. Finkelstein[92]), but further construction work was stalled until 2006 due to disputes over money, security and design.[91] The last major issues were resolved on April 26, 2006, when a deal was struck between developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on June 23, 2006.[93] For two months during the summer of 2006, explosives were detonated at the World Trade Center construction site, testing the use of charges to clear bedrock for the building's foundations. On November 18, 2006, 400 cubic yards (310 cubic meters) of concrete were poured onto the foundations, carried by as many as 40 trucks.[94] On December 17, 2006, a ceremony was held in Battery Park City, with members of the public invited to sign a 30-foot (9.1 m) steel beam.[95] This beam, the first to be installed, was welded onto the building's base on December 19, 2006.[96] Afterwards, construction of the foundation and further steel installation commenced, and by the end of 2007, the tower's footings and foundations were nearly complete.[97]In January 2008, two construction cranes were moved onto the site. The tower's concrete core began rising in the first months of 2008,[97] and had reached street level by May 17. Construction of the base continued through 2009 and was completed by January 2010. That same month, construction of the office floors began, then afterwards the installation of the first glass windows. In May 2010, the Port Authority stated that they were building nearly one floor of the tower per week, and it was projected that 1 WTC would reach 55 stories by the end of 2010.[98] An advanced ""cocoon"" scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling, marking the first time that such a safety system had been installed on a steel structure in the city.[99]On December 16, 2010, the Port Authority announced that the tower's construction had reached the 52nd floor, rising to over 600 feet (180 m) and marking the halfway point for the tower's steel frame.[100] By September 11, 2011, ten years after the destruction of the original World Trade Center, the tower's steel had reached the 82nd floor, while its concrete flooring had reached the 72nd floor, and glass cladding had reached the 56th floor.[101]While under construction, the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions.[102] On the weekend of July 4, 2011, it was lit up in the colors of the American flag to commemorate Independence Day, and it was lit up in the same colors on September 10 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.[103] On October 27, it was illuminated in pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.[102] On December 11, the Port Authority illuminated the tower in multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season.[102] On February 24, 2012, the building was lit up in red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, who became a cardinal on February 18.[102] On June 14, 2012, it was illuminated in red, white, and blue to honor Flag Day.[102] In August, it was illuminated in red in honor of the Armed Forces.[102] On September 8, 2012, it was again illuminated in red, white, and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.[104] On June 24, 2013, One World Trade Center was again illuminated in red, white, and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July.[102] On November 12, 2013, three hundred red, white, and blue lights were lit up.[105]On January 31, 2012, the Port Authority stated that the tower's loading dock would not be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building, and that five temporary loading bays would be added instead, at a cost of millions. The temporary Trans Hudson station will not be removed until its replacement is completed, preventing access to the planned loading area.[106] By March 2012, One World Trade Center's steel had reached the 93rd floor,[13] and on March 30, the 100th floor was reached at a height of 1,240 feet (380 m).[107] Though this floor was numbered as floor 100, it was in fact the 94th floor constructed since the intervening space was occupied by the high-ceilinged mechanical 91st floor.[107] The incomplete tower became New York City's tallest building by roof height, superseding the 1,250-foot (380 m) roof height of the Empire State Building, on April 30, 2012.[18] The Empire State Building's total spire height of 1,454 feet (443 m) remained unsurpassed until 2013, when One World Trade Center's antenna was installed.On June 2, 2012, a fire broke out on the 89th floor of the tower, but was extinguished by New York City firefighters before causing any injuries or serious structural damage. However, firefighting efforts were delayed because the tower's emergency standpipes were found to be dry.[108] On June 14, 2012, President Barack Obama visited the construction site and signed a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower. Obama wrote, ""We remember, we rebuild, we come back stronger!""[109]In August 2012, One World Trade Center's steel officially topped out at the nominal 104th floor, at a total height of 1,368 feet (417 m). The tower's antenna was shipped to New York in November 2012;[110] the first antenna section was hoisted to the top of the tower on December 12, 2012,[111] and installed on January 15, 2013.[112]By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire was expected to be completed on April 29, 2013, but weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces.[113] On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing it to its full height of 1,776 feet (541 m), and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world.[114]As of April 2014, the exterior elevator shaft was being removed, podium glass was being installed, interior decorating and finishings were being installed, and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was complete.[13] The building opened on November 3, 2014, with 2,300 employees of its first tenant, magazine publisher Conde Nast, moving into spaces spread among 24 floors",wikipedia,0"The Scaled Composites Model 339 SpaceShipTwo (SS2) is an air-launched suborbital spaceplane design for space tourism. It is manufactured by The Spaceship Company, a California-based company that is wholly owned by its sister company Virgin Galactic. The Spaceship Company was formerly a joint venture between Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composites, but Virgin became the company's sole owner in 2012.[1]Together with its mother ship carrier it forms the The Spaceship Company Tier 1b[2] where SpaceShipTwo is carried to its launch altitude by a Scaled Composites White Knight Two, before being released to fly on into the upper atmosphere powered by its rocket engine. It then glides back to Earth and performs a conventional runway landing.[3] The spaceship was officially unveiled to the public on 7 December 2009 at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California.[4] On 29 April 2013, after nearly three years of unpowered testing, the first one constructed successfully performed its first powered test flight.[5]Virgin Galactic plans to operate a fleet of five SpaceShipTwo spaceplanes in a private passenger-carrying service[6][7][8][9] and have been taking bookings for some time, with a suborbital flight carrying an initial ticket price of US$200,000.[10] The spaceplane could also be used to carry scientific payloads for NASA and other organizations.[11]On 31 October 2014 during a test flight, VSS Enterprise, the first SpaceShipTwo craft broke up in-flight and crashed in the Mojave desert.[12][13][14][15][16] A preliminary investigation suggests the ""feathering"" system, the ship's descent device, deployed too early.[17][18] One pilot was confirmed dead, another is being treated for a serious shoulder injury[19] after parachuting from 50,000 feet.[20][full citation needed] A second SpaceShipTwo, VSS Voyager, is under construction.Contents  [hide] 1 Design overview2 Fleet and launch site3 Development3.1 2007 test explosion3.2 Rocket engine3.2.1 RocketMotorTwo3.2.2 2014 Change of engine manufacturer and hybrid engine fuel3.3 SpaceShipTwo test flights3.4 Costs3.5 October 2014 crash4 Commercial operation4.1 NASA sRLV program4.2 Future spacecraft5 Production6 Specifications7 See also8 References9 External linksDesign overview[edit]A schematic diagram of SpaceShipTwo.The SpaceShipTwo project is based in part on technology developed for the first-generation SpaceShipOne, which was part of the Scaled Composites Tier One program, funded by Paul Allen. The Spaceship Company licenses this technology from Mojave Aerospace Ventures, a joint venture of Paul Allen and Burt Rutan, the designer of the predecessor technology.SpaceShipTwo is a low-aspect-ratio passenger spaceplane. Its capacity will be eight people „ six passengers and two pilots. The apogee of the new craft will be approximately 110 km (68 mi) in the lower thermosphere, 10 km (6.2 mi) higher than the Kàrmàn line which was SpaceShipOne's target, although the last flight of SpaceShipOne reached a one-time altitude of 112 km (70 mi). SpaceShipTwo will reach 4,200 km/h (2,600 mph), using a single hybrid rocket engine „ the RocketMotorTwo.[21] It launches from its mother ship, White Knight Two, at an altitude of 15,000 metres (50,000 ft), and reaches supersonic speed within 8 seconds. After 70 seconds, the rocket engine cuts out and the spacecraft will coast to its peak altitude. SpaceShipTwo's crew cabin is 3.7 m (12 ft) long and 2.3 m (7.5 ft) in diameter.[22] The wing span is 8.2 m (27 ft), the length is 18 m (60 ft) and the tail height is 4.6 m (15 ft).[23]SpaceShipTwo uses a feathered reentry system, feasible due to the low speed of reentry. In contrast, the Space Shuttle and other orbital spacecraft re-enter at orbital speeds, closer to 25,000 km/h (16,000 mph), using heat shields. SpaceShipTwo is furthermore designed to re-enter the atmosphere at any angle.[24] It will decelerate through the atmosphere, switching to a gliding position at an altitude of 24 km (15 mi), and will take 25 minutes to glide back to the spaceport.SpaceShipTwo and White Knight Two are, respectively, roughly twice the size of the first-generation SpaceShipOne and mother ship White Knight, which won the Ansari X Prize in 2004. SpaceShipTwo has 43 and 33 cm (17 and 13 in) -diameter windows for the passengers' viewing pleasure,[23] and all seats will recline back during landing to decrease the discomfort of G-forces.[25] Reportedly, the craft can land safely even if a catastrophic failure occurs during flight.[26] In 2008, Burt Rutan remarked on the safety of the vehicle:This vehicle is designed to go into the atmosphere in the worst case straight in or upside down and it'll correct. This is designed to be at least as safe as the early airliners in the 1920s ... DonÍt believe anyone that tells you that the safety will be the same as a modern airliner, which has been around for 70 years.[24]In September 2011, the safety of SpaceShipTwo's feathered reentry system was tested when the crew briefly lost control of the craft during a gliding test flight. Control was reestablished after the spaceplane entered its feathered configuration, and it landed safely after a 7-minute flight.[27]Fleet and launch site[edit]The launch customer of SpaceShipTwo is Virgin Galactic, who have ordered five vehicles.[28][29] The first two were named VSS Enterprise[30] and VSS Voyager. The ""VSS"" prefix stands for ""Virgin Space Ship"". As of November 2014, only VSS Enterprise has been flown;[31] it was destroyed in a crash on 31 October 2014. The build of the second aircraft„VSS Voyager„is about 65 percent complete as of early November 2014, and Virgin Galactic expects it to be complete in 2016.[32] The WhiteKnightTwo carrying SpaceShipTwo craft take off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California during testing. Spaceport America (formerly Southwest Regional Spaceport), a US$212 million spaceport in New Mexico, partly funded by the state government[33], will become the permanent launch site when commercial launches begin.[22]Development[edit]On 28 September 2006, Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson unveiled a mock-up of the SpaceShipTwo passenger cabin at the NextFest exposition at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York.[34] The design of the vehicle was revealed to the press in January 2008, with the statement that the vehicle itself was around 60% complete.[22] On 7 December 2009, the official unveiling and rollout of SpaceShipTwo took place. The event involved the first SpaceShipTwo being christened by then-Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger as the VSS Enterprise.[35]2007 test explosion[edit]On 26 July 2007, an explosion occurred during an oxidizer flow test at the Mojave Air and Space Port, where early-stage tests were being conducted on SpaceShipTwo's systems. The oxidizer test included filling the oxidizer tank with 4,500 kilograms (10,000 lb) of nitrous oxide, followed by a 15-second cold-flow injector test. Although the tests did not ignite the gas, three employees were killed and three injured, two critically and one seriously, by flying shrapnel.[36]Rocket engine[edit]The hybrid rocket engine design for SpaceShipTwo has been problematic and caused extensive delays to the flight test program. The original rocket engine design was based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer, sometimes referred to as an N2O/HTPB engine.[37][38] It was developed by Scaled Composites subcontractor Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) from 2009 to early 2014. In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid engine to be used in SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house to Virgin Galactic, terminating the contract with Sierra Nevada and halting all development work on the first-generation rocket engine.[39] Virgin then modified the engine design to include a change of the hybrid rocket fuel from a HTPB to a polyamide fuel formulation.RocketMotorTwo[edit]Main article: RocketMotorTwoBetween 2005 and 2009, Scaled Composites conducted numerous small-scale rocket tests to evaluate SpaceShipTwo's engine design. After settling on the RocketMotorTwo hybrid rocket design to be developed by Sierra Nevada, the company began performing full-scale hot-fire rocket tests in April 2009.[40] By December 2012, 15 full-scale tests had been successfully conducted,[40][41] and additional ground tests continued into March 2013.[42] In June 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a rocket testing permit to Scaled Composites, allowing it to begin SS2 test flights powered by RocketMotorTwo;[43] the first such powered flight took place on 29 April 2013.[44] The Sierra Nevada HTPB-based RocketMotorTwo design generated 60,000 lbf (270 kN) of thrust.[45]2014 Change of engine manufacturer and hybrid engine fuel[edit]In May 2014, Virgin Galactic took over engine development from Sierra Nevada[39] and announced a change to the fuel to be used in the SpaceShipTwo hybrid rocket engine. Rather than the rubber-based HTPB-fuel engine„engines that had experienced serious engine stability issues on firings longer than approximately 20 seconds„the engine would now be based on a solid fuel composed of a type of plastic called thermoplastic polyamide. The plastic fuel was projected to have better performance (by several unspecified measures) and was projected to allow SpaceShipTwo to make flights to a higher altitude.[46][47][48]As of May 2014 when the version 2 engine by Virgin Galactic was publicly announced, the engine had already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an engine test stand.[47] The second-generation engine design also required the modification to the SS2 airframe to fit additional tanks in the wings of SpaceShipTwo„one holding methane and the other containing helium„in order to ensure a proper burn and shut-down of the new engine.[49] Additional ground tests were performed of the new engine between May and October 2014.SpaceShipTwo test flights[edit]Main article: VSS EnterpriseSpaceShipTwo in a captive flight configuration underneath White Knight Two, during the runway dedication of Spaceport America in October 2010. VMS Eve is shown carrying VSS Enterprise.A view of the firing of SpaceShipTwo's rocket engines during its first powered flight in April 2013.As of October 2014, SpaceShipTwo has conducted 54 test flights.[50] The spacecraft has used its ""feathered"" wing configuration during ten of these test flights.[50][51][52]In September 2012, Virgin Galactic announced that the unpowered subsonic glide flight test program was essentially complete.[53] In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket engine, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.[54][55]The spacecraft's first powered test flight took place on 29 April 2013. SpaceshipTwo reached supersonic speeds in this first powered flight.[56][57] On 5 September 2013, the second powered flight was made by SpaceShipTwo.[58] The first powered test flight of 2014„and third overall„occurred 10 January 2014. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 22,000 metres (71,000 ft) (the highest to date) and a speed of Mach 1.4. The WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft released SpaceShipTwo (VSS Enterprise) at an altitude of 14,000 metres (46,000 ft).[59]Costs[edit]SpaceShipTwo's total development costs were estimated at around $400 million in May 2011, a significant increase over the 2007 estimate of $108 million.[60]October 2014 crash[edit]Main article: 2014 Virgin Galactic crashOn October 31, 2014, SpaceShipTwo suffered an ""anomaly"" during a powered flight test,[61] resulting in a crash killing one pilot and injuring the other.[12][13][62] It was the first flight to use the new type of fuel, based on nylon plastic grains.[63][64] The crash is believed to have involved a premature deployment of the feathering mechanism on the tail system, to aid in a safe descent at speeds of 1.4 Mach. SpaceShip Two was still in ascent and had only reached Mach 1 when the feathering mechanism deployed, 2 seconds before disintegration was observed.[65] The cause of the accident is still under investigation.Commercial operation[edit]The duration of the flights will be approximately 2.5 hours, though only a few minutes of that will be in space. The price will initially be $200,000.[66] More than 65,000 would-be space tourists applied for the first batch of 100 tickets. By December 2007, Virgin Galactic had 200 paid-up customers on its books for the early flights, and 95% were passing the 6-8 g centrifuge tests.[67] By the start of 2011, that number had increased to over 400 paid customers,[68] and to 575 by early 2013.[69] In April 2013, Virgin Galactic announced that the price for a seat would increase 25 percent to $250,000 before the middle of May 2013,[69] and would remain at $250,000 ""until the first 1,000 people have traveled, so that it matches up with inflation since [Virgin Galactic] started.""[70]Following 50_100 test flights, the first paying customers are expected to fly aboard the craft in 2014.[6] Refining the projected schedule in late 2009, Virgin Galactic declined to announce a firm timetable for commercial flights, but did reiterate that initial flights would take place from Spaceport America. Operational roll-out will be based on a ""safety-driven schedule"".[71] In addition to making suborbital passenger launches, Virgin Galactic will market SpaceShipTwo for suborbital space science missions.[71]NASA sRLV program[edit]By March 2011, Virgin Galactic had submitted SpaceShipTwo as a reusable launch vehicle for carrying research payloads in response to NASA's suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) solicitation, which is a part of the agency's Flight Opportunities Program. Virgin projects research flights with a peak altitude of 110 km (68 mi). These flights will provide approximately four minutes of microgravity for research payloads. Payload mass and microgravity levels have not yet been specified.[3] The NASA research flights could begin during the test flight certification program for SpaceShipTwo.[citation needed]Future spacecraft[edit]In August 2005, the president of Virgin Galactic stated that if the suborbital service with SpaceShipTwo is successful, the follow-up SpaceShipThree will be an orbital craft. In 2008, Virgin Galactic changed their plans and decided to make it a high-speed passenger vehicle, offering transport through point-to-point suborbital spaceflight.[72]Production[edit]While the first White Knight Two and the first SpaceShipTwo were built by Scaled Composites, The Spaceship Company has responsibility for the manufacture of the second White Knight Two aircraft and the second SS2 spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, as well as additional production craft as other customers for the vehicles emerge.[73] In October 2010, TSC announced plans to build three White Knight Two aircraft and five SpaceShipTwo spaceplanes",wikipedia,0"As of 2014, the most widespread epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in history is currently ongoing in three West African countries.[8][9] It has caused significant mortality, with a reported case fatality rate (CFR) of about 71%.[10][11] It began in Guinea in December 2013 and then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.[11] A small outbreak of nineteen cases occurred in Nigeria, and one case occurred in Senegal. The latter two countries were declared disease-free on 20 October 2014 after a 42 day waiting period.[6][12][13] Secondary infections of medical workers have occurred in the United States and Spain[14][15] but have not spread further. One imported case has been identified in Mali[16][17] with two more possible cases under investigation.[18] An independent outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that started in August 2014 has been shown by genetic analysis to be unconnected to the main epidemic.[19]As of 29 October 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total of 13,567 suspected cases and 4,960 deaths,[20] though the WHO believes that this substantially understates the magnitude of the outbreak[21] with true figures numbering three times as many cases as have been reported.[3][22] The assistant director-general of the WHO warned in mid-October that there could be as many as 10,000 new EVD cases per week by December 2014.[23] Almost all of the cases have occurred in the three initial countries.Some countries have encountered difficulties in their efforts to control the epidemic.[24] In some areas, people have become suspicious of both the government and hospitals, some of which have been attacked by angry protesters who believe either that the disease is a hoax or that the hospitals are responsible for the disease. Many of the areas seriously affected by the outbreak are areas of extreme poverty with limited access to the soap and running water needed to help control the spread of disease.[25] Other factors include reliance on traditional medicine and cultural practices that involve physical contact with the deceased, especially death customs such as washing and kissing[26] the body of the deceased.[27][28][29] Some hospitals lack basic supplies and are understaffed, increasing the chance of staff catching the virus themselves. In August, the WHO reported that ten percent of the dead have been health care workers.[30] By the end of August, the WHO reported that the loss of so many health workers was making it difficult for them to provide sufficient numbers of foreign medical staff.[31] In September, the WHO estimated that the countries' capacity for treating EVD patients was insufficient by the equivalent of 2,122 beds. By the end of October many of the hospitals in the affected area had become dysfunctional or had been closed, leading some health experts to state that the inability to treat other medical needs may be causing ""an additional death toll [that is] likely to exceed that of the outbreak itself"".[32][33]By September 2014, M_decins Sans Frontires/Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the largest NGO working in the affected countries, had grown increasingly critical of the international response. Speaking on 3 September, the president of MSF spoke out concerning the lack of assistance from the United Nations member countries saying, ""Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it.""[34] A United Nations spokesperson stated, ""They could stop the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 6 to 9 months, but only if a 'massive' global response is implemented.""[35] The Director-General of the WHO, Margaret Chan, called the outbreak ""the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen"" and said that it is ""racing ahead of control efforts"".[35] In a 26 September statement, the WHO said, ""The Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times.""[36] Many have compared this epidemic to the 14th century Black Death pandemic in Europe.[37]Articles related to theEbola virus epidemic inWest AfricaEbola virus virion.jpgOverviewEbola virus diseaseTimeline of the epidemicResponses to the epidemicAffected nationsGuinea ´ Liberia ´ Sierra Leone ´ MaliSpain ´ United StatesOther outbreaksList of Ebola outbreaks1976 Zaire outbreak2014 Congo outbreakv t eContents  [hide] 1 Epidemiology1.1 Outbreak1.2 Countries with widespread transmission1.3 Countries with limited local transmission1.4 Countries with initial cases1.5 Countries with contained spread1.6 Countries with medically evacuated cases1.7 Separate outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo2 Virology3 Transmission4 Prevention4.1 Surveillance and contact tracing4.2 Community awareness4.3 Travel restrictions & quarantines5 Treatment5.1 Prognosis5.2 Level of care5.3 Healthcare settings5.4 Experimental treatments5.5 Experimental preventative vaccines6 Outlook6.1 Statistical measures6.2 Projections of future cases7 Economic effects8 Responses9 Timeline of reported cases and deaths10 References11 External linksEpidemiology[edit]Outbreak[edit]See also: 2014 Ebola virus disease epidemic timelineEbola Outbreak in West Africa - Outbreak distribution map as of 29 October 2014[38]Researchers believe that a 2-year-old boy, later identified as Emile Ouamouno, who died in December 2013 in the village of Meliandou, Gu_ck_dou Prefecture, Guinea, was the index case of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic.[39][40] Reports suggest that his family hunted bats of the Ebola-harboring species Hypsignathus monstrosus and Epomops franqueti for bushmeat, which may have been the original source of the infection.[41][42] His mother, sister, and grandmother then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. People infected by those initial cases spread the disease to other villages.[1] Although Ebola represents a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa, no cases had ever been reported in West Africa and the early cases were diagnosed as other diseases more common to the area. Thus, the disease had several months to spread before it was recognized as Ebola.[1][43]On 19 March, the Guinean Ministry of Health acknowledged a local outbreak of an undetermined viral hemorrhagic fever that had sickened at least 35 people and killed 23. ""We thought it was Lassa fever or another form of cholera but this disease seems to strike like lightning. We are looking at all possibilities, including Ebola, because bushmeat is consumed in that region and Guinea is in the Ebola belt.""[44] By 24 March, MSF had set up an isolation facility in Gu_ck_dou.[45]On 25 March, Peter Capaldi, the CEO of the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Guinea's Ministry of Health had reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in four southeastern districts, with suspected cases in the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone being investigated. In Guinea, a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths (case fatality ratio: 68.5%), had been reported as of 24 March.[46] By 31 March, there were 112 suspected and confirmed cases including 70 deaths, while two cases were reported from Liberia of people who had recently traveled to Guinea.[46] On 30 April, Guinea's Ministry of Health reported 221 suspected and confirmed cases with 146 deaths, including 26 health care workers with 16 deaths. By late May, the outbreak had spread to Conakry, Guinea's capital, a city of about two million inhabitants.[46] On 28 May, the total number of cases reported had reached 281 with 186 deaths.[46]In Liberia, the disease was reported in four counties by mid-April and cases in Liberia's capital Monrovia were reported in mid-June.[47][48] The outbreak then spread to Sierra Leone and progressed rapidly. A study of the virus genomes determined that twelve Sierra Leone residents had become infected while attending a funeral in Guinea.[49] On 25 May, the first cases in the Kailahun District, near the border with Gu_ck_dou in Guinea, were reported.[50] By 20 June, there were 158 suspected cases, mainly in Kailahun and the adjacent district of Kenema.[51] By 17 July, the total number of suspected cases in the country stood at 442, overtaking the number in Guinea and Liberia.[52] By 20 July, additional cases of the disease had been reported in the Bo District and the first case in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, was reported in late July.[53][54]The first death in Nigeria was reported on 25 July:[55] a Liberian-American with Ebola flew from Liberia to Nigeria and died in Lagos soon after arrival.[56] As part of the effort to contain the disease, possible contacts were monitored _ 353 in Lagos and 451 in Port Harcourt.[57] On 22 September, the WHO reported a total of 20 cases, including eight deaths. The WHO's representative in Nigeria officially declared Nigeria Ebola-free on 20 October after no new active cases were reported in the follow up contacts.[6]On 29 August, Senegalese Minister of Health announced the first case in Senegal. The victim was subsequently identified as a Guinean national who had been exposed to the virus and had been under surveillance, but had travelled to Dakar by road and fallen ill after arriving.[58] This person subsequently recovered, and on 17 October, the WHO officially declared that the outbreak in Senegal had ended.[59]Two Spanish health care workers contracted Ebola and were transferred to Spain for treatment where they both died. In October, a nursing assistant who had been part of their health care team was diagnosed with Ebola, making this the first case of Ebola contracted outside of Africa. The nursing assistant recovered and was declared disease-free on 19 October.[60] There have been cases of Ebola in the United States of America as well. A Liberian man who had traveled from Liberia to be with his family in Texas was declared to have Ebola and subsequently died on 8 October. Two nurses who had cared for the patient contracted the disease and as of 20 October remain in treatment.[61] Both of these nurses have subsequently recovered and tested Ebola-free 27 October 2014.Countries with widespread transmission[edit]Guinea[edit]Main article: Ebola virus epidemic in GuineaOn 25 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Guinea's Ministry of Health had reported an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in four southeastern districts. In Guinea, a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths (case fatality ratio: 68.5%), had been reported as of 24 March.[46] On 31 March, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent a five-person team to assist Guinea's Ministry of Health and the WHO as they led an international response to the Ebola outbreak.[46]Thinking that the virus was contained, MSF closed its treatment centers in May leaving only a small skeleton staff to handle the Macenta region. However, high numbers of new cases reappeared in the region in late August. According to Marc Poncin, a coordinator for MSF, the new cases were related to persons returning to Guinea from neighbouring Liberia or Sierra Leone.[62]It has been reported that some people in this area believe that health workers have been purposely spreading the disease to the people, while others believe that the disease does not exist. Riots recently broke out in the regional capital, Nz_r_kor_, when rumors were spread that people were being contaminated when health workers were spraying a market area to decontaminate it.[63]On 18 September, it was reported that the bodies of a team of Guinean health and government officials, accompanied by journalists, who had been distributing Ebola information and doing disinfection work, were found in a latrine in the town of Womey near Nz_r_kor_.[64] The workers had been murdered by residents of the village after they initially went missing after a riot against the presence of the health education team. Government officials said ""the bodies showed signs of being attacked with machetes and clubs"" and ""three of them had their throats slit.""[65]WHO estimated on 21 September that Guinea's capacity to treat EVD cases falls short by the equivalent of 40 beds.[24] On 13 October, France indicated it would build more treatment centers.[66] On 18 October, Egypt sent three tons of medical aid, consisting of medicine and medical equipment.[67]On 19 October Guinea have reported two new districts with EVD cases. The Kankan district, on the border with the Cªte d'Ivoire and a major trade route to Mali, confirmed 1 case. Kankan also borders the district of Kerouane in this country, one of the areas with the most intense virus transmissions. The Faranah district to the north of the border area of Koinadugu in Sierra Leone in the north also reported a confirmed case. Koinadugu was one of the last EVD free regions in that country. According to the latest WHO report this new developmental highlights the need for increased surveillance of cross border traffic in an effort to contain the disease to the three most affected countries.[20]Liberia[edit]Main article: Ebola virus epidemic in LiberiaAn Ebola treatment unit in LiberiaIn Liberia, the disease was reported in Lofa and Nimba counties in late March.[68] In July, the health ministry implemented measures to improve the country's response.[69] On 27 July, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, announced that Liberia would close its borders, with the exception of a few crossing points such as the airport, where screening centres would be established.[70] Football events were banned,[71] schools and universities were closed,[72][73] and the worst-affected areas in the country were to be placed under quarantine.[74]In August, President Sirleaf declared a national state of emergency, noting that it might require the ""suspensions of certain rights and privileges"".[75] The National Elections Commission announced that it would be unable to conduct the scheduled October 2014 senatorial election and requested postponement,[76] one week after the leaders of various opposition parties had publicly taken different sides on the question.[77] In late August, Liberia's Port Authority cancelled all ""shore passes"" for sailors from ships coming into the country's four seaports.[78] As of 8 September, Ebola had been identified in 14 of Liberia's 15 counties.[79]With only 50 physicians in the entire country„one for every 70,000 Liberians„Liberia already faced a health crisis even before the outbreak.[80] In September the US CDC reported that some hospitals had been abandoned while those which were still functioning lacked basic facilities such as running water, rubber gloves, and sanitizing supplies.[81] The WHO estimated that Liberia's capacity to treat EVD cases fell short by the equivalent of 1,550 beds.[24] In September, a new 150-bed treatment clinic was opened in Monrovia. At the opening ceremony six ambulances were already waiting with potential patients. More patients were waiting by the clinic after making their way on foot with the help of relatives.[82]In October, the Liberian ambassador in Washington was reported as saying that he feared that his country may be ""close to collapse"".[80] On 12 October, Liberian nurses threatened a strike over wages.[83] On 14 October, another 100 U.S. troops arrived, bringing the total to 565 to aid in the fight against the disease.[84] On 16 October, U.S. President Obama authorized, via executive order, the use of National Guard and reservists to Liberia.[85] A report of 15 October indicates that Liberia needs 80,000 more body bags and about 1 million protective suits for the next six months.[86] On October 20, the Liberian ambassador to Canada indicated it was time to try the ZMapp drug on the infected in Liberia.[87]By 19 October only one area in Liberia, Grand Gedeh, had yet to report an EVD case; 14 out of the 15 districts had reported cases. In the capital of Monrovia 305 new cases were reported in the past week alone.[20] On 24 October this district became the last to report cases. Grand Gedeh reported 4 cases of which 2 tested positive.[88] On 27 October, U.S. soldiers returning from Liberia were put in isolation upon their arrival in Italy.[89] On 29 October, the WHO announced that the rate of new infections in Liberia was declining, but urged continued vigilance against a reversal of this trend. [90]Sierra Leone[edit]Main article: Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra LeoneKenema Hospital, Sierra LeoneThe first person reported infected in the spread to Sierra Leone was a tribal healer. She had treated one or more infected people and died on 26 May. According to tribal tradition, her body was washed for burial and this appears to have led to infections in women from neighbouring towns.[91] On 11 June, Sierra Leone shut its borders for trade with Guinea and Liberia and closed some schools in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.[92] On 30 July, the government began to deploy troops to enforce quarantines.[93]On 29 July, well-known physician Sheik Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's only expert on hemorrhagic fever, died after contracting Ebola at his clinic in Kenema. Khan had long worked with Lassa fever, a disease that kills over 5,000 a year in Africa. He had expanded his clinic to accept Ebola patients. Sierra Leone's president, Ernest Bai Koroma, celebrated Khan as a ""national hero"".[91]In August, awareness campaigns in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, were delivered over the radio and through loudspeakers.[94] Also in August, Sierra Leone passed a law that subjected anyone hiding someone believed to be infected to two years in jail. At the time the law was enacted, a top parliamentarian criticised failures by neighbouring countries to stop the outbreak.[95]In an attempt to control the disease, Sierra Leone imposed a three-day lockdown on its population from 19 to 21 September. During this period 28,500 trained community workers and volunteers went door-to-door providing information on how to prevent infection, as well as setting up community Ebola surveillance teams.[96] On 22 September, government officials said that the three-day lockdown had obtained its objective and would not be extended. Eighty percent of targeted households were reached in the operation. A total of around 150 new cases were uncovered, although reports from remote locations had not yet been received.[97]WHO estimated on 21 September that Sierra Leone's capacity to treat EVD cases falls short by the equivalent of 532 beds.[24] There have been reports that political interference and administrative incompetence have hindered the flow of medical supplies into the country.[98] On 4 October, Sierra Leone recorded 121 fatalities, the largest number in a single day.[99] On 8 October, Sierra Leone burial crews went on strike.[100] On 12 October, it was reported that the U.K. would begin providing military support to Sierra Leone.[101]The last district in Sierra Leone untouched by the Ebola virus has declared Ebola cases. According to Abdul Sesay, a local health official, 15 suspected deaths with two confirmed cases of the deadly disease were reported on 16 October in the village of Fakonya. The village is 60 miles from the town of Kabala in the center of a mountainous region of the Koinadugu district. All of the districts in this country now have confirmed cases of Ebola.[102] On 24 October, U.K. Prime Minister Cameron pledged 80 million (pounds) to Sierra Leone's fight against the virus,and asked other countries in Europe to donate.[103] On 28 October, the Sierra Leone government took exception to a ban, imposed on the same day, by the Australian government for any visas issued towards individuals from the affected west African region. Amnesty International stated it was a ""narrow approach"".[104]On October 30, about 300 UK personnel, with 3 helicopters and 32 trucks, arrived on the British ship Argus.[105] On November 1st, it was reported the UK would begin building three new Ebola treatment centers; ""there are just not enough testing facilities"", according to one source.[106] On November 2, the vast nature of the ""under-reporting"" was brought to light: ""the situation is catastrophic. There are several villages and communities that have been basically wiped out. In one of the villages I went to, there were 40 inhabitants and 39 died"", one source cited.[107]Countries with limited local transmission[edit]Spain[edit]Main article: Ebola virus disease cases in SpainOn 5 August 2014, the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God confirmed that Brother Miguel Pajares, who had been volunteering in Liberia, had become infected. He was evacuated to Spain on 6 August, and died on 12 August.[108] On 21 September it was announced that Brother Manuel GarcÕa Viejo, another Spanish citizen who was medical director at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Lunsar, had been evacuated to Spain from Sierra Leone after being infected with the virus. His death was announced on 25 September.[109]In October, a nursing assistant, later identified as Teresa Romero, who had cared for these patients became unwell and on 6 October tested positive for Ebola.[110] A second test confirmed the diagnosis,[111] making this the first confirmed case of Ebola transmission outside Africa. On 19 October, it was reported that Romero had recovered and was officially declared to be Ebola free.[60]United States[edit]Main article: Ebola virus disease in the United StatesSee also: _ Travel restrictions and quarantinesOn 30 September, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared its first case of Ebola virus disease. The CDC disclosed that Thomas Eric Duncan became infected in Liberia and traveled to Texas on 20 September. On 26 September he fell ill and sought medical treatment but was sent home with antibiotics. He returned to the hospital by ambulance on 28 September and was placed in isolation and tested for Ebola.[112][113] Thomas Duncan died on 8 October.[114] On 19 October his four relatives and 44 other people who had had contact with Duncan were released from quarantine.[115]On 12 October, the CDC confirmed that a health worker who treated Duncan tested positive for the Ebola virus, making this the first known transmission of the disease in the United States. Two days later a second health worker at the same hospital tested positive for Ebola.[116] Nina Pham, the first nurse infected, was transferred to a facility at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland on 16 October,[117] while the second, Amber Joy Vinson, was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.[61] Both patients recovered and were declared free of the virus by 24 October.[118] A fourth case of Ebola virus disease was diagnosed on 23 October in New York City. MSF doctor Craig Spencer had recently returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa where he contracted the disease.[119] On 28 October, Spencer's condition was listed as serious; he had ""entered the next phase"" of the viral infection, as per Bellevue hospital.[120]Countries with initial cases[edit]Mali[edit]Main article: Ebola virus disease in MaliOn 23 October, the first case of Ebola disease in Mali was confirmed; a two year-old girl who had returned from Guinea.[17] According to a health ministry official, the girl's mother had died in Guinea a few weeks previously and the child was then brought by relatives to Mali.[16] It was reported that she and her grandmother had arrived in Bamako on 20 October after attending the funeral of her father, who died of Ebola. They then arrived in Kayes the next day.[121]On 24 October, a health official reported that the girl had died as a result of Ebola disease.[122] Many people may have been exposed during her bus journey from Guinea, when she was already symptomatic.[123][124] On 25 October, Mauritania, as a preventive measure, closed its border with Mali.[125] On 28 October the WHO stated ""the possibility of setting up a treatment center in Kayes"" had been discussed.[126]On 29 October WHO reported that 82 contacts are being traced with 57 in Kayes and 27 in Bamako.[5]On 31 October, Reuters reported that two more suspected cases of Ebola virus disease had been identified.[18]Countries with contained spread[edit]Senegal[edit]In March, the Senegal Ministry of Interior closed the southern border with Guinea,[127] but on 29 August the Senegal health minister announced Senegal's first case, a university student from Guinea who was being treated in a Dakar hospital.[58] The case was a native of Guinea who had traveled to Dakar, arriving on 20 August. On 23 August, he sought medical care for symptoms including fever, diarrhoea, and vomiting. He received treatment for malaria, but did not improve and left the facility. Still experiencing the same symptoms, on 26 August he was referred to a specialized facility for infectious diseases, and was subsequently hospitalized.[58]On 28 August, authorities in Guinea issued an alert informing medical services in Guinea and neighbouring countries that a person who had been in close contact with an Ebola infected patient had escaped their surveillance system. The alert prompted testing for Ebola at the Dakar laboratory, and the positive result launched an investigation and triggered urgent contact tracing.[58] On 10 September, it was reported that the student had recovered but health officials would continue to monitor his contacts for 21 days.[128] No further cases were reported.[129] and on 17 October, the WHO officially declared that the outbreak in Senegal had ended.[7]The WHO have officially commended the Senegalese government, and in particular the President Macky Sall and the Minister of Health Dr Awa Coll-Seck, for their quick response in quickly isolating the patient and tracing and following up 74 contacts as well as for their public awareness campaign. This acknowledgement was also extended to MSF and the CDC for their assistance.[130]Nigeria[edit]Nigerian health care workers receiving training in August 2014The first case in Nigeria was a Liberian-American, Patrick Sawyer, who flew from Liberia to Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos on 20 July. Sawyer became violently ill upon arriving at the airport and died five days later. In response, the Nigerian government observed all of Sawyer's contacts for signs of infection and increased surveillance at all entry points to the country.[131] On 6 August, the Nigerian health minister told reporters, ""Yesterday the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five [newly confirmed] cases are being treated at an isolation ward.""[132]On 19 August, it was reported that the doctor who treated Sawyer, Ameyo Adadevoh, had also died of Ebola disease. Adadevoh was posthumously praised for preventing the index case (Sawyer) from leaving the hospital at the time of diagnosis, thereby playing a key role in curbing the spread of the virus in Nigeria.[133][134]On 22 September, the Nigeria health ministry announced, ""As of today, there is no case of Ebola in Nigeria. All listed contacts who were under surveillance have been followed up for 21 days."" According to the WHO, 19 cases and 7 deaths had been confirmed, along with the imported case, who also died. Four of the dead were health care workers who had cared for Sawyer. In all, 529 contacts had been followed and of that date they had all completed a 21 day mandatory period of surveillance.[135] The WHO's representative in Nigeria officially declared Nigeria to be Ebola free on 20 October after no new active cases were reported in the follow up contacts, stating it was a ""spectacular success story"".[6]On 9 October, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) acknowledged Nigeria's positive role in controlling the effort to contain the Ebola outbreak. ""We wish to thank the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja, Nigeria, and the staff of the Ebola Emergency Centre who coordinated the management of cases, containment of outbreaks and treatment protocols in Nigeria."" Nigeria's quick responses, including intense and rapid contact tracing, surveillance of potential contacts, and isolation of all contacts were of particular importance in controlling and limiting the outbreak, according to the ECDC.[136] Complimenting Nigeria's successful efforts to control the outbreak, ""the usually measured WHO declared the feat 'a piece of world-class epidemiological detective work'.""[137]Countries with medically evacuated cases[edit]  Widespread transmission: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia  Local transmissions - no deaths: Texas, Spain  Initial cases - deaths: Texas, Mali  Initial cases - no deaths: New York  Medically evacuated cases - deaths: Spain, Germany  Medically evacuated cases - no deaths: Nebraska, Georgia, Maryland, United Kingdom, France, Norway, Switzerland  Previously had cases, now Ebola-free: Senegal, NigeriaA number of people who had become infected with Ebola virus disease have been medically evacuated to treatment in isolation wards in Europe or the US. These are mostly health workers with one of the NGOs in the area.France[edit]A French volunteer health worker, working for MSF in Liberia, contracted EVD and was flown to France on 18 September. After successful treatment at Hospital Begin, a military hospital near Paris, she was discharged on 4 October.[138]On 1 November 2014, a United Nations employee suffering from Ebola was evacuated from Sierra Leone to France for treatment. The person, whose gender wasnÍt disclosed, is not a French citizen.[139]Germany[edit]Germany set up an isolation ward to care for six patients at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. On 27 August, a Senegalese epidemiologist working for the WHO in Sierra Leone became the first patient. On 4 October he was discharged after being declared noninfectious.[140]The WHO requested that a Ugandan doctor working in Sierra Leone who had contracted the disease be treated in Germany. The request was granted by Germany and he was flown to the country on 3 October. The patient is being treated in an isolation unit at the University Hospital in Frankfurt. The doctor was working for an Italian NGO in Sierra Leone, according to Stefan Gruettner, the State Health Minister of Hessen.[141]On 9 October, a third patient was medevaced to Leipzig, Germany. The 56-year-old Sudanese man, who worked as a UN employee in Liberia, was transferred to St Georg Hospital in Leipzig.[142] He died on 14 October, becoming the first person on German soil to die of Ebola.[143]Norway[edit]On 6 October, MSF announced that one of their workers, a Norwegian national, had become infected in Sierra Leone. On 7 October the woman, Silje Lehne Michalsen, was admitted to a special isolation unit at Oslo University Hospital.[144][145] On 20 October, it was announced that she had been successfully treated and had been discharged. It was reported that Michalsen had received an unspecified drug as part of her treatment plan.[146] After discharge Michalsen remarked, ""For three months I saw the total absence of an international response. For three months I became more and more worried and frustrated.""[145]United Kingdom[edit]An isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London, received its first case on 24 August. William Pooley, a British nurse, was evacuated from Sierra Leone by the Royal Air Force on a specially-equipped C-17 aircraft. He was released from hospital on 3 September.[147][148]United States[edit]A number of American citizens who contracted Ebola virus disease while working in the affected areas have been evacuated to the United States for treatment; none have died.",wikipedia,0"The French Invasion of Russia (French: Campagne de Russie) or the Patriotic War of 1812 (Russian: _____________ _____ 1812 ____) (Otechestvennaya Voyna 1812 Goda) began on 24 June 1812 when Napoleon's Grande Arm_e crossed the Neman River in an attempt to engage and defeat the Russian army.[6] Napoleon hoped to compel Tsar Alexander I of Russia to cease trading with British merchants through proxies in an effort to pressure the United Kingdom to sue for peace.[7] The official political aim of the campaign was to liberate Poland from the threat of Russia. Napoleon named the campaign the Second Polish War to gain favor with the Poles and provide a political pretense for his actions.[8]The Grande Arm_e was a very large force, numbering 680,000 soldiers (including 300,000 of French departments). Through a series of long marches Napoleon pushed the army rapidly through Western Russia in an attempt to bring the Russian army to battle, winning a number of minor engagements and a major battle at Smolensk in August. Napoleon hoped the battle would mean an end of the march into Russia, but the Russian army slipped away from the engagement and continued to retreat into Russia, while leaving Smolensk to burn.[9] Plans Napoleon had made to quarter at Smolensk were abandoned, and he pressed his army on after the Russians.[10]As the Russian army fell back Cossacks were given the task of burning villages, towns and crops.[7] This was intended to deny the invaders the option of living off the land. These scorched-earth tactics greatly surprised and disturbed the French, as the willingness of the Russians to destroy their own territory and harm their own people was difficult for the French to comprehend.[11] The actions forced the French to rely on a supply system that was incapable of feeding the large army in the field. Starvation and privation compelled French soldiers to leave their camps at night in search of food. These men were frequently confronted by parties of Cossacks, who captured or killed them.The Russian army retreated into Russia for almost three months. The continual retreat and the loss of lands to the French upset the Russian nobility. They pressured Alexander I to relieve the commander of the Russian army, Field Marshal Barclay. Alexander I complied, appointing an old veteran, Prince Mikhail Kutuzov, to take over command of the army.On 7 September the French caught up with the Russian army which had dug itself in on hillsides before a small town called Borodino, seventy miles west of Moscow. The battle that followed was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars, involving more than 250,000 soldiers and resulting in 70,000 casualties. The French gained a victory, but at the cost of 49 general officers and thousands of men. The Russian army was able to extricate itself and withdrew the following day, leaving the French without the decisive victory Napoleon sought.[12]Napoleon entered Moscow a week later. In another turn of events the French found puzzling, there was no delegation to meet the Emperor. The Russians had evacuated the city, and the city's governor, Count Fyodor Rostopchin, had ordered the city to be burnt.[13] Napoleon's hopes had been set upon a victorious end to his campaign, but victory in the field did not yield him victory in the war. The loss of Moscow did not compel Alexander I to sue for peace, and both sides were aware that Napoleon's position grew worse with each passing day. Napoleon stayed on in Moscow looking to negotiate a peace, his hopes fed in part by a disinformation campaign informing the Emperor of supposed discontent and fading morale in the Russian camp. After staying a month Napoleon moved his army out southwest toward Kaluga, where Kutuzov was encamped with the Russian army.The French advance toward Kaluga was checked by a Russian corps. Napoleon tried once more to engage the Russian army for a decisive action at the Battle of Maloyaroslavets. Despite holding a superior position, the Russians retreated following a sharp engagement, confirming that the Russians would not commit themselves to a pitched battle.[14] His troops exhausted, with few rations, no winter clothing, and his remaining horses in poor condition, Napoleon was forced to retreat. He hoped to reach supplies at Smolensk and later at Vilnius. In the weeks that followed the Grande Arm_e starved and suffered from the onset of the Russian Winter. Lack of food and fodder for the horses, hypothermia from the bitter cold and persistent attacks upon isolated troops from Russian peasants and Cossacks led to great losses in men, and a general loss of discipline and cohesion in the army. When the remnants of Napoleon's army crossed the Berezina River in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers remained; the Grand Arm_e had lost some 380,000 men dead and 100,000 captured.[15] Following the crossing of the Berezina Napoleon left the army, after much urging from his advisors and with the unanimous approval of his Marshals.[16] He returned to Paris by carriage and sledge to protect his position as Emperor and to raise more forces to resist the advancing Russians. The campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, not quite six months from its outset, with the last French troops leaving Russian soil.The campaign was a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.[1] The reputation of Napoleon was severely shaken, and French hegemony in Europe was dramatically weakened. The Grande Arm_e, made up of French and allied invasion forces, was reduced to a fraction of its initial strength. These events triggered a major shift in European politics. France's ally Prussia, soon followed by Austria, broke their alliance with France and switched camps. This triggered the War of the Sixth Coalition.[17]Contents  [hide] 1 Causes2 Logistics3 Opposing forces3.1 Grande Arm_e3.2 Russian Imperial Army4 Invasion4.1 Crossing the Niemen4.2 March on Vilnius4.3 March on Moscow5 The Battle of Borodino5.1 Capture of Moscow6 Retreat and rebuilding6.1 Fire of Moscow7 Retreat and losses8 Weather as a factor9 Historical assessment9.1 Alternative names9.2 Aftermath9.3 Historical echos9.4 Cultural impact10 See also11 Notes12 Further reading12.1 Historiography12.2 Russian studies12.3 Primary sources12.4 Fiction13 External linksCauses[edit]Although the Napoleonic Empire seemed to be at its height in 1810 and 1811,[18] it had in fact already declined somewhat from its apogee in 1806-1809. While most of Western and Central Europe lay under his control - either directly or indirectly through various protectorates, allies, and countries defeated by his empire and under treaties favorable for France - Napoleon had embroiled his armies in the costly and drawn-out Peninsular War in Spain and Portugal. France's economy, army morale, and political support at home had noticeably declined. But most importantly, Napoleon himself was not in the same physical and mental state as in years past. He had become overweight and increasingly prone to various maladies.[19] Nevertheless, despite his troubles in Spain, with the exception of British expeditionary forces to that country, no European power dared move against him.[20]The Treaty of Sch_nbrunn, which ended the 1809 war between Austria and France, had a clause removing Western Galicia from Austria and annexing it to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Russia viewed this as against its interests and as a potential launching-point for an invasion of Russia.[21] In 1811 Russian staff developed a plan of offensive war, assuming a Russian assault on Warsaw and on Danzig.[22]In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon in his own words termed this war the Second Polish War:Soldiers, the second war of Poland is started; the first finished in Tilsit. In Tilsit, Russia swore eternal alliance in France and war in England. It violates its oaths today. Russia is pulled by its fate; its destinies must be achieved! Does it thus believe us degenerated? Thus let us go ahead; let us pass Neman River, carry the war on its territory. The second war of Poland will be glorious with the French Armies like the first one.[23]Napoleon's ""first"" Polish war, the War of the Fourth Coalition to liberate Poland (from Russia, Prussia and Austria), he saw as such because one of the official declared goals of this war was the resurrection of the Polish state on territories of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.Tsar Alexander found Russia in an economic bind as his country had little in the way of manufacturing yet was rich in raw materials and relied heavily on trade with Napoleon's continental system for both money and manufactured goods. Russia's withdrawal from the system was a further incentive to Napoleon to force a decision.[24]Logistics[edit]Patriotic War of 1812. Advance of Napoleon's army (June 24 - October 2, 1812)The invasion of Russia clearly and dramatically demonstrates the importance of logistics in military planning, especially when the land will not provide for the number of troops deployed in an area of operations far exceeding the experience of the invading army.[25] Napoleon and the Grande Arm_e had developed a proclivity for living off the land that had served it well in the densely populated and agriculturally rich central Europe with its dense network of roads.[26] Rapid forced marches had dazed and confused old order Austrian and Prussian armies and much had been made of the use of foraging.[26] In Russia many of the Grande Arm_e's methods of operation worked against it and they were additionally seriously handicapped by the lack of winter horse shoes which made it impossible for the horses to obtain traction on snow.[27] Forced marches often made troops do without supplies as the supply wagons struggled to keep up.[26] Lack of food and water in thinly populated, much less agriculturally dense regions led to the death of troops and their mounts by exposing them to waterborne diseases from drinking from mud puddles and eating rotten food and forage. The front of the army received whatever could be provided while the formations behind starved.[28]Napoleon had in fact made extensive preparations providing for the provisioning of his army. Seventeen train battalions, comprising 6000 vehicles, were to provide a 40-day supply for the Grande Arm_e and its operations, and a large system of magazines was established in towns and cities in Poland and East Prussia.[29] At the start of the campaign, no march on Moscow was envisioned and so the preparations would have sufficed. However, the Russian armies could not stand singularly against the main battle group of 285,000 men and continued to retreat and attempt to join one another. This demanded an advance by the Grande Arm_e over a network of dirt roads that dissolved into deep mires, where ruts in the mud froze solid, killing already exhausted horses and breaking wagons.[30] As the graph of Charles Joseph Minard, given below, shows, the Grande Arm_e incurred the majority of its losses during the march to Moscow during the summer and autumn. Starvation, desertion, typhus and suicide would cost the French Army more men than all the battles of the Russian invasion combined.[31]Opposing forces[edit]Main article: Order of battle of the French invasion of RussiaGrande Arm_e[edit]French infantry in 1812On 24 June 1812, the 450,000 men of the Grande Arm_e, the largest army assembled up to that point in European history, crossed the river Neman and headed towards Moscow. Anthony Joes in Journal of Conflict Studies wrote that:Figures on how many men Napoleon took into Russia and how many eventually came out vary rather widely.[Georges] Lefebvre says that Napoleon crossed the Neman with over 600,000 soldiers, only half of whom were from France, the others being mainly Poles and Germans.Felix Markham thinks that 450,000 crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, of whom fewer than 40,000 recrossed in anything like a recognizable military formation.James Marshall-Cornwall says 510,000 Imperial troops entered Russia.Eugene Tarle believes that 420,000 crossed with Napoleon and 150,000 eventually followed, for a grand total of 570,000.Richard K. Riehn provides the following figures: 685,000 men marched into Russia in 1812, of whom around 355,000 were French; 31,000 soldiers marched out again in some sort of military formation, with perhaps another 35,000 stragglers, for a total of fewer than 70,000 known survivors.Adam Zamoyski estimated that between 550,000 and 600,000 French and allied troops (including reinforcements) operated beyond the Niemen, of which as many as 400,000 troops died.[32]""Whatever the accurate number, it is generally accepted that the overwhelming majority of this grand army, French and allied, remained, in one condition or another, inside Russia.""„Anthony Joes[33]M. Minard's famous infographic (see below) depicts the march ingeniously by showing the size of the advancing army, overlaid on a rough map, as well as the retreating soldiers together with temperatures recorded (as much as 30 below zero on the R_aumur scale) on their return. The numbers on this chart have 422,000 crossing the Neman with Napoleon, 22,000 taking a side trip early on in the campaign, 100,000 surviving the battles en route to Moscow and returning from there; only 4,000 survive the march back, to be joined by 6,000 that survived from that initial 22,000 in the feint attack northward; in the end, only 10,000 crossed the Neman back out of the initial 422,000.[34]Russian Imperial Army[edit]Main article: List of Russian commanders in the Patriotic War of 1812General of Infantry Mikhail Bogdanovich Barclay de Tolly served as the Commander in Chief of the Russian Armies, a field commander of the First Western Army and Minister of War, Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov replaced him, and assumed the role of Commander-in-chief during the retreat following the Battle of Smolensk.As irregular cavalry, the Cossack horsemen of the Russian steppes were best suited to reconnaissance, scouting and harassing the enemy's flanks and supply lines.These forces, however, could count on reinforcements from the second line, which totaled 129,000 men and 8,000 Cossacks, with 434 guns and 433 rounds of ammunition.Of these about 105,000 men were actually available for the defense against the invasion. In the third line were the 36 recruit depots and militias, which came to the total of approximately 161,000 men of various and highly disparate military values, of which about 133,000 actually took part in the defense.Thus, the grand total of all the forces was 488,000 men, of which about 428,000 gradually came into action against the Grand Army. This bottom line, however, includes more than 80,000 Cossacks and militiamen, as well as about 20,000 men who garrisoned the fortresses in the operational area.Sweden, Russia's only ally, did not send supporting troops. But the alliance made it possible to withdraw the 45,000-man Russian corps Steinheil from Finland and use it in the later battles (20,000 men were sent to Riga).[35]Invasion[edit]Crossing the Niemen[edit]The Grande Arm_e crossing the NiemenThe invasion commenced on 24 June 1812. Napoleon had sent a final offer of peace to Saint Petersburg shortly before commencing operations. He never received a reply, so he gave the order to proceed into Russian Poland. He initially met little resistance and moved quickly into the enemy's territory. The French coalition of forces amounted to 449,000 men and 1,146 cannons being opposed by the Russian armies combining to muster 153,000 Russians, 938 cannons, and 15,000 Cossacks.[36] The center of mass of French forces focused on Kaunas and the crossings were made by the French Guard, I, II and III corps amounting to some 120,000 at this point of crossing alone.[37] The actual crossings were made in the area of Alexioten where three pontoon bridges were constructed. The sites had been selected by Napoleon in person.[38] Napoleon had a tent raised and he watched and reviewed troops as they crossed the Niemen.[39] Roads in this area of Lithuania hardly qualified as such, actually being small dirt tracks through areas of dense forest.[40] Supply lines simply could not keep up with the forced marches of the corps and rear formations always suffered the worst privations.[41]March on Vilnius[edit]The 25th of June found Napoleon's group past the bridge head with Ney's command approaching the existing crossings at Alexioten. Murat's reserve cavalry provided the vanguard with Napoleon the guard and Davout's 1st corp following behind. Eugene's command would cross the Niemen further north at Piloy, and MacDonald crossed the same day. Jerome command wouldn't complete its crossing at Grodno until the 28th. Napoleon rushed towards Vilnius pushing the infantry forward in columns that suffered from heavy rain then stifling heat. The central group would cross 70 miles (110 km) in two days.[42] Ney's III corps would march down the road to Suderv_ with Oudinot marching on the other side of the Neris River in an operation attempting to catch General Wittgenstein's command between Ney, Oudinout and Macdonald's commands, but Macdonald's command was late in arriving to an objective too far away and the opportunity vanished. Jerome was tasked with tackling Bagration by marching to Grodno and Reynier's VII corps sent to Bia_ystok in support.[43]The Russian headquarters was in fact centered in Vilnius on June 24 and couriers rushed news about the crossing of the Niemen to Barclay de Tolley. Before the night had passed orders were sent out to Bagration and Platov to take the offensive. Alexander left Vilnius on June 26 and Barclay assumed overall command. Although Barclay wanted to give battle he assessed it as a hopeless situation and ordered Vilnius's magazines burned and its bridge dismantled. Wittgenstein moved his command to Perkele passing beyond Macdonald and Oudinot's operations with Wittgenstein's rear guard clashing with Oudinout's forward elements.[43] Doctorov on the Russian Left found his command threatened by Phalen's III cavalry corp. Bagration was ordered to Vileyka which moved him towards Barclay though the order's intent is still something of a mystery to this day.[44]General Raevsky leading a detachment of the Russian Imperial Guard at the Battle of Saltanovka.On June the 28th Napoleon entered Vilnius with only light skirmishing. The foraging in Lithuania proved hard as the land was mostly barren and forested. The supplies of forage were less than that of Poland and two days of forced marching made a bad supply situation worse.[44] Central to the problem were the expanding distances to supply magazines and the fact that no supply wagon could keep up with a forced marched infantry column.[45] The weather itself became an issue where according to historian Richard K. Riehn:The thunderstorms of the 24th turned into other downpours, turning the tracks„„some diarists claim there were no roads in Lithuania„„into bottomless mires. Wagon sank up to their hubs; horses dropped from exhaustion; men lost their boots. Stalled wagons became obstacles that forced men around them and stopped supply wagons and artillery columns. Then came the sun which would bake the deep ruts into canyons of concrete, where horses would break their legs and wagons their wheels.[45]A Lieutenant Mertens „ a Wurttemberger serving with Ney's III corps „ reported in his diary that oppressive heat followed by rain left them with dead horses and camping in swamp-like conditions with dysentery and influenza raging though the ranks with hundreds in a field hospital that had to be set up for the purpose. He reported the times, dates and places, of events reporting thunderstorms on the 6th of June and men dying of sunstroke by the 11th.[45] The Crown Prince of Wurttemberg reported 21 men dead in bivouacs. The Bavarian corps was reporting 345 sick by June 13.[46]Desertion was high among Spanish and Portuguese formations. These deserters proceeded to terrorize the population, looting whatever lay to hand. The areas in which the Grande Arm_e passed were devastated. A Polish officer reported that areas around him were depopulated.[46]The French light Cavalry was shocked to find itself outclassed by Russian counterparts so much so that Napoleon had ordered that infantry be provided as back up to French light cavalry units.[46] This affected both French reconnaissance and intelligence operations. Despite 30,000 cavalry, contact was not maintained with Barclay's forces leaving Napoleon guessing and throwing out columns to find his opposition.[47]Eagles monument in Smolensk, commemorating the centenary of the Russian defeat of Napoleon.French Carabiniers-ö-Cheval during the Russian Campaign.The operation intended to split Bagration's forces from Barclay's forces by driving to Vilnius had cost the French forces 25,000 losses from all causes in a few days.[46] Strong probing operations were advanced from Vilnius towards Nemen_in_, Mykoli_k_s, Ashmyany and Mol_tai.[46]Eugene crossed at Prenn on June 30 while Jerome moved VII Corps to Bia_ystok, with everything else crossing at Grodno.[47] Murat advanced to Nemen_in_ on July 1 running into elements of Doctorov's III Russian Cavalry Corps en route to Djunaszev. Napoleon assumed this was Bagration's 2nd Army and rushed out before being told it was not 24 hours later. Napoleon then attempted to use Davout, Jerome and Eugene out on his right in a hammer and anvil to catch Bagration to destroy the 2nd army in an operation spanning Ashmyany and Minsk. This operation had failed to produce results on his left before with Macdonald and Oudinot. Doctorov had moved from Djunaszev to Svir narrowly evading French forces, with 11 regiments and a battery of 12 guns heading to join Bagration when moving too late to stay with Doctorov.[48]Conflicting orders and lack of information had almost placed Bagration in a bind marching into Davout; however, Jerome could not arrive in time over the same mud tracks, supply problems, and weather, that had so badly affected the rest of the Grande Arm_e, losing 9000 men in four days. Command disputes between Jerome and General Vandamme would not help the situation.[49] Bagration joined with Doctorov and had 45,000 men at Novi-Sverzen by the 7th. Davout had lost 10,000 men marching to Minsk and would not attack Bagration without Jerome joining him. Two French Cavalry defeats by Platov kept the French in the dark and Bagration was no better informed with both overestimating the other's strength, Davout thought Bagration had some 60,000 men and Bagration thought Davout had 70,000. Bagration was getting orders from both Alexander's staff and Barclay (which Barclay didn't know) and left Bagration without a clear picture of what was expected of him and the general situation. This stream of confused orders to Bagration had him upset with Barclay which would have repercussions later.[50]Napoleon reached Vilnius on the 28th of June leaving 10,000 dead horses in his wake. These horses were vital to bringing up further supplies to an army in desperate need. Napoleon had supposed that Alexander would sue for peace at this point and was to be disappointed; it would not be his last disappointment.[51] Barclay continued to retreat to the Drissa deciding that the concentration of the 1st and 2nd armies was his first priority.[52]Barclay continued his retreat and with the exception of the occasional rearguard clash remained unhindered in his movements ever further east.[53] To date the standard methods of the Grande Arm_e were working against it. Rapid forced marches quickly caused desertion, starvation, exposed the troops to filthy water and disease, while the logistics trains lost horses by the thousands, further exacerbating the problems. Some 50,000 stragglers and deserters became a lawless mob warring with local peasantry in all-out guerrilla war, that further hindered supplies reaching the Grand Armee which was already down 95,000 men.[54]March on Moscow[edit]Barclay, the Russian commander-in-chief, refused to fight despite Bagration's urgings. Several times he attempted to establish a strong defensive position, but each time the French advance was too quick for him to finish preparations and he was forced to retreat once more. When the French army progressed further, serious problems in foraging surfaced, aggravated by scorched earth tactics of the Russian army[55][56] advocated by Karl Ludwig von Phull.[57]Political pressure on Barclay to give battle and the general's continuing reluctance to do so (viewed as intransigence by the Russian nobility) led to his removal. He was replaced in his position as commander-in-chief by the popular Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov. Kutuzov, however, continued much along the line of the general Russian strategy, fighting the occasional defensive engagement but being careful not to risk the army in an open battle. Instead the Russian army fell back ever deeper into Russia's interior. Following a defeat at Smolensk on August 16_18 he continued the move east. Unwilling to give up Moscow without a fight, Kutuzov took up a defensive position some 75 miles before Moscow at Borodino.The Battle of Borodino[edit]Main article: Battle of BorodinoNapoleon and his staff at BorodinoThe Battle of Borodino (Russian: ___________ _____, Borodinskaya bitva; French: Bataille de la Moskowa), fought on September 7, 1812,[58] was the largest and bloodiest battle of the French invasion of Russia, involving more than 250,000 troops and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties.[59] The French Grande Arm_e under Emperor Napoleon I attacked the Imperial Russian Army of General Mikhail Kutuzov near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk and eventually captured the main positions on the battlefield but failed to destroy the Russian army. About a third of Napoleon's soldiers were killed or wounded; Russian losses, while heavier, could be replaced due to Russia's large population, since Napoleon's campaign took place on Russian soil.The battle ended with the Russian Army, while out of position, still offering resistance.[60] The state of exhaustion of the French forces and the lack of recognition of the state of the Russian Army led Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of the forced pursuit that had marked other campaigns that he had conducted.[61] The entirety of the Guard was still available to Napoleon and in refusing to use it he lost this singular chance to destroy the Russian army.[62] The battle at Borodino was a pivotal point in the campaign, as it was the last offensive action fought by Napoleon in Russia. By withdrawing, the Russian army preserved its combat strength, eventually allowing it to force Napoleon out of the country.The Battle of Borodino on September 7 was the bloodiest day of battle in the Napoleonic Wars. The Russian army could only muster half of its strength on September 8 and was forced to retreat, leaving the road to Moscow open. Kutuzov also ordered the evacuation of the city.By this point the Russians had managed to draft large numbers of reinforcements into the army bringing total Russian land forces to their peak strength in 1812 of 904,000 with perhaps 100,000 in the vicinity of Moscow „ the remnants of Kutuzov's army from Borodino partially reinforced.Capture of Moscow[edit]Napol_on and General Lauriston „ Peace at all costs! by Vasily Vereshchagin.On September 14, 1812, Napoleon moved into the empty city that was stripped of all supplies by its governor, Feodor Rostopchin. Relying on classical rules of warfare aiming at capturing the enemy's capital (even though Saint Petersburg was the political capital at that time, Moscow was the spiritual capital of Russia), Napoleon had expected Tsar Alexander I to offer his capitulation at the Poklonnaya Hill but the Russian command did not think of surrendering.As Napoleon prepared to enter Moscow he was surprised to have received no delegation from the city. At the approach of a victorious general, the civil authorities customarily presented themselves at the gates of the city with the keys to the city in an attempt to safeguard the population and their property. As nobody received Napoleon he sent his aides into the city, seeking out officials with whom the arrangements for the occupation could be made. When none could be found, it became clear that the Russians had left the city unconditionally.[63]In a normal surrender, the city officials would be forced to find billets and make arrangements for the feeding of the soldiers, but the situation caused a free-for-all in which every man was forced to find lodgings and sustenance for himself. Napoleon was secretly disappointed by the lack of custom as he felt it robbed him of a traditional victory over the Russians, especially in taking such a historically significant city.[63]Before the order was received to evacuate Moscow, the city had a population of approximately 270,000 people. As much of the population pulled out, the remainder were burning or robbing the remaining stores of food, depriving the French of their use. As Napoleon entered the Kremlin, there still remained one-third of the original population, mainly consisting of foreign traders, servants and people who were unable or unwilling to flee. These, including the several hundred strong French colony, attempted to avoid the troops.Retreat and rebuilding[edit]Patriotic War of 1812. The expulsion of Napoleon's army from Russia (October 18 „ December 14, 1812)Both Armies began to move and rebuild. The Russian retreat was significant for two reasons; firstly, the move was to the south and not the east; secondly, the Russians immediately began operations that would continue to deplete the French forces. Platov, commanding the rear guard on the 8th of September, offered such strong resistance that Napoleon remained on the Borodino field.[60] On the 9th of September Miloradovitch assumed command of the rear guard adding his forces to the formation. Another battle was given throwing back French forces at Semolino causing 2,000 losses on both sides, however some 10,000 wounded would be left behind by the Russian Army.[64] The French Army began to move out on Sept. 10th with the still ill Napoleon not leaving until the 12th. Some 18,000 men were ordered in from Smolensk, and Marshal Victor's corps supplied another 25,000.[65] Miloradovich would not give up his rear guard duties until the 14th allowing much of Moscow to be deserted, and retreated under a truce at last.[66]Fire of Moscow[edit]Main article: Fire of Moscow (1812)The fire of Moscow (September 1812)Upon entering Moscow, the Grande Arm_e found the city largely abandoned. Fyodor Rostopchin who was the military governor of Moscow, had ordered the city evacuated, including all the city administrators and officials, leaving behind only a few French tutors, foreign shop keepers and those that were the lowest class of society.[67] No one was on hand to meet the Emperor Napoleon when he arrived at the city gates on September 14. In addition to abandoning the city, Rostopchin had ordered the prisons to be opened. On the first night of French occupation a fire broke out in the Bazaar. There was no administrative means on hand to organize fighting the fire, and no pumps or hoses could be found. Later that night a couple more fires broke out in the suburbs. These were thought to be due to carelessness on the part of the soldiers.[68] Some looting occurred and a military government was hastily set up in an attempt to keep order.The following night the city began to burn in earnest. Fires broke out across the north part of the city, spreading and merging over the next few days. Rostopchin had left a small detachment of police, whom he charged with burning the city to the ground.[69] Houses had been prepared with flammable materials.[70] The city's fire-engines had been dismantled. Fuses were left throughout the city to ignite the fires.[71] French troops endeavored to fight the fire with whatever means they could, struggling to prevent the armory from exploding and to keep the Kremlin from burning down. The heat was intense. Moscow, composed largely of wooden buildings, burnt down almost completely. It was estimated that four-fifths of the city was destroyed.",wikipedia,0
